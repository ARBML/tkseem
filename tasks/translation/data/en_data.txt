We can't predict it and we can't control it 
136 miles an hour 
The awesome cycle of water around the planet 
I've been for 
I can't talk 
I'll experience the dark side of summer 
It's going to be the ride of a lifetime 
This is Wild Weather 
Donal hi 
Are you ready for this 
Pilot Two cleared for take off 
This is where it all comes from 
But thankfully they don't go on for ever 
And this is it six and a half miles up 
The weather stops here 
All the moisture in the air has dried out 
And beyond it space 
In just a few heart stopping moments 
Take it away Barry 
And this is where it all begins 
This is where the wind is actually born 
It's hot damned hot 
And what's really strange is there's no wind 
And that's because this is the doldrums 
Way above a huge pattern emerges 
And all this from a place of dead calm 
Water on board was limited 
That's how one sailor remembered it 
That's because the doldrums follow the seasons 
I can feel that breeze now 
Let's get outta here 
Every wind on Earth begins its cycle here 
Today that object is going to be me 
At 40 miles an hour 
Force 8 it's getting tough to stand up 
Tree branches are already breaking 
But I'm still standing as you can see 
It's taking my full weight 
The nightmare began on Friday August 14 
Andrew continued to build 
Andrew was now officially a hurricane 
We thought it would move out to sea 
Florida lay just ten hours ahead 
Andrew was now 100 miles across 
I was in denial This isn't happening 
If you can see it's the beginnings of Andrew 
This is just one little squall 
We have much more to go 
Sunday 23rd August 
We're going to weather it out 
Hi Daniell Hil 
Boy did you hear that 
It is blowing out there 
I've never seen anything like it before 
We can feel our ears constantly pop 
The winds outside are at least 110 mph 
Aaron are you OK 
People asked did I hear the roof rip off 
Things pressed down on us in a tiny space 
The water level was rising 
It fell on top of us and pinned us there 
Hallelujah 
Hallelujah 
It shakes me when I see the film 
The lightweight structures had no chance 
This is the worst 
There's many trailer parks in this area 
This is another typical street 
Everything total rubble 
It's one of the fastest on Earth 
It's a record attempt 
Lucky me 
 
We'll aim for the speed of the jet stream 
We can do it 
If it's too dangerous obviously still do it 
If it's too dangerous 
Y ou're a braver man than mel 
There was nothing we could do 
It was quite a design 
Pretty smart 
They mark the boundaries between the wind cells 
That's what the jet stream did for us 
And this is where it all began to go wrong 
It suddenly disappeared 
It's like the fingers on a hand 
It fragments 
Five agonising days passed 
This was no longer a race for a world record 
It was a desperate bid to stay alive 
And then the jet stream reappeared 
We've done itl 
The tunnel can do it 
The question is can I 
Not yet anyway 
Off 
Enough 
Enough 
Nowhere near the speed of a jet stream 
I wouldn't recommend it though 
Oh dear 
In the real world it's nothing like this 
No safety lines no controlled environment 
It's a nightmare 
That's double the speed I've just tried 
It sat there for a minute then moved right 
We came over here 
We ran this way 
We got in here 
All of us got in here 
The exact mechanism is still unclear 
When it touches the earth a twister is born 
The consequences can be lethal 
I said Where's your mother 
She didn't make it 
She died that night 
She said Don't joke I said I'm not 
Nothing there isn't nothing out here 
What have we got here 
Their injuries were horrific 
The survivors bore all the hallmarks 
The next day the damage became clear 
Kelly Cox lost her mother up there 
The Underwoods lived over the hill here 
Those people will always haunt me 
Once is enough 
Wind creates friction on any surface 
So we're getting a bigger kite 
Y eah 
I'm heavy and we need some air 
That's the real reason isn't it 
That's right 
Bit of a ballerina about me out there 
Very smooth 
Y ou were on your toes 
Am I a bit too smug for a beginner 
We'll see how you do on the board 
The result is waves 
Nine ten eleven 
If there's no wind there's no waves 
The answer is a lot closer to home 
Having travelled across the Atlantic to Ireland 
They're like monsters they rumble 
They're huge they just engulf you 
And they did 
Perfect 
Good visibility light breeze 
But 1979 was different 
On August 10th 4 000 miles away to the west 
The effect was like turbo charging 
But this time the boat didn't come upright 
This time it remained upside down 
As I was held down in the water 
I just felt cross and disappointed 
That was the last I ever saw of him 
This was wind and waves at their wildest 
They defeated the best sailors in the world 
It's the fastest wind of them all 
65 miles above our heads 
The Aurora the northern and southern lights 
But does the solar wind affect our weather 
Yes but no one knows exactly how 
It's been quite a ride 
August 10th: 
Eleven 
Even if the people close to him got involved 
He refused to halt 
Even if it's his own siblings 
Even if he sacrifices friendships 
Even if a path towards loneliness awaits him 
I see 
Understanding is happiness 
right 
This illness 
can't you be a bit more obedient 
Enough excuses already 
you turned me into this thing as revenge 
Let's head back to our motherland 
we shouldn't be arguing about that 
Britannia 
I am Zero 
Zero 
A rebel against those with power 
I'll wait until 0:00 hours 
Surrender and submit to my army 
The entire settlement 
Confirm the positions of the enemies now 
Your Highness 
Euphemia's revenge 
Zero 
face to face confrontation 
This is my ultimatum 
I'll wait until 0:00 hours 
Surrender and submit to my army 
Stop it 
If you do that 
Can you stop hindering me 
Stop fooling around 
If you don't stop immediately 
How are the preparations for the bombers 
They are able to match our timing 
All right 
Prepare to fire 
What 
An earthquake 
I won't be finished off here 
Zero You're indeed amazing 
Villetta and Jeremiah guessed right after all 
That's wonderful then 
What is the status of the enemy aerial forces 
and Awaji 
All right This is the time then 
Charge 
Team Three will head towards the press agencies 
The rest will engage in a frontal assault 
Retreat Retreat 
Your Highness 
What's wrong 
Cornelia identified Brace yourself 
Prepare yourself 
You vengeful ghost 
Princess 
Leave this to me 
Guilford 
That bastard I met at Narita 
you must retreat 
It's for Princess Euphemia's sake too 
That's the same thing as the Lancelot's 
That is why I will defend this spot 
I understand 
Guilford 
Your Highness 
Eh 
The school area 
you'll be stationed there 
right To the Tokyo Settlement 
However 
Congratulations 
you'll be violating orders if you launch now 
but 
You can't do this 
Zero is in Tokyo 
I will defeat Zero with my own hands 
Don't hinder me 
I will do it 
are we going to charge 
How are the other teams doing 
They are attempting to flank the enemy 
The Graston Knights 
we have already set up a formation ahead 
Please head back 
Sorry You have my thanks 
Please don't say that 
Do you know what the situation is like 
only the militia remains once we're done here 
In other words 
They're trash 
I've already taken care of the aerial forces 
You'll move to the designated spot 
Understood 
prepare the Raikon 
Okay 
We are moving 
Okay 
if the target appears 
Understood 
All right 
what is the name of our supporter 
A Ah She's called Shinozaki Sayoko 
communication has been terminated 
Even the Chinese Federation 
He went there again 
Odysseus 
Asking me that so suddenly 
Princess Cornelia is 
I will go 
I Is that so 
You will go 
isn't it People killing each other 
Superconducting Maglev style Shrapnel Cannon 
Fire 
advance 
So that is indeed what they're planning 
We'll be taking over this area 
You will follow our instructions 
H How can that be 
D Don't tell me 
Zero 
This is the movement that'll change the world 
Section Chief 
all the broadcasting stations are 
Raise your hands and turn around 
the Order of the Black Knights 
Put your guns away 
Huh What are you saying at a time like this 
Let me act cool for once 
I will protect everyone 
I see 
Stop it 
I already told you not to do anything to them 
Somewhere else 
do we 
I'll guarantee everyone's safety 
So 
There's no way we'll believe that 
Huh Kallen 
I see 
So that's what's going on 
Can you promise me this 
but everyone in this school 
I think it should be fine 
right 
Something to me 
Huh 
Cruel how cruel the Lancelot is here 
It came after all 
Move aside 
Where is Zero 
I will finish off Zero 
That's right Zero has an extraordinary power 
Don't tell me 
doing at Shikinejima 
In other words 
an Eleven and I actually 
Suzaku 
Kallen 
Don't be an idiot 
The way you say it pisses me off 
What the heck do you know about Zero 
Then tell me 
Zero 
Where the heck is Zero 
answer me Where the heck is Zero 
there's no way I'll tell you that 
Then I'll finish you off here 
Don't act arrogant just because you can fly 
Caught you 
Take this 
talk Where is Zero 
I hate persistent men 
Is that so 
Then I'll finish you off here 
Is there anything you want to say 
Wait 
Kururugi Suzaku 
It's na ve for me to feel attached to you 
Just what I wanted 
Asahina 
How is Urabe faring 
Understood 
Give orders to Lord Cray to retreat 
Your Highness 
Cornelia 
Keep it as it is 
Your Highness 
how are things on Brother's side 
The Pacific Ocean fleet will arrive in 75 hours 
in about thirty more minutes 
Cornelia 
It's preparation for the banquet 
Zero 
You still can't calm him down 
He's strongly resisting it 
Has the enemy's aerial fleet arrived 
it seems like a sole machine 
right 
Kaguya sama is around to act as a decoy as well 
We'll win once we secure the rear 
A student 
Let him go if that's the case 
There's no reason for us to imprison them 
Snuck 
Oh 
Chigusa 
Lead her to another room 
I'll personally listen to her report 
Kallen what will they do to us 
It'll be fine 
Huh 
The Order of the Black Knights will 
Zero will definitely not hurt us 
How are you so certain 
Despicable 
You intend to hold them hostage 
Wasn't this supposed to be one on one 
Impossible 
because if that's true 
Zero 
Go 
This is 
as promised 
do whatever you wish with that machine 
I have no time for a hypocritical game 
Kururugi Suzaku 
Damn it 
as expected 
Is this the time to act carefree 
The enemy reinforcements are about to land 
right 
I know 
I'm just creating a distraction 
Why do you know that 
someday 
Wait for that day 
Zero 
it's a welcoming banquet 
I wonder if you like dancing 
why did you come to the battlefield 
But I'm doing this for the sake of peace 
We can be together 
Don't say something so disgusting 
Ohgi was shot 
Yes The medical team is tending to him now 
Was that woman the one who shot him 
The details are still unclear 
We are still investigating 
It'll cause a commotion among our comrades 
Just search for that woman 
I understand 
even Suzaku will be 
Did something happen 
that is the best thing to do 
Where's the light switch 
Beats me 
479 }Zero 
Euphemia sama's

Hatred against the Britannian Royal Family 
You are killing others for such nonsense 
Hmph 
In that case seek an answer from you 
Yes

No 
Then who did it I don't know

Why were the guards withdrawn 
By Mother How can this be

Who did it 
Who killed Mother 
 
You don't know 
The facts surrounding that day 
Mother's corpse Then what's inside that coffin 
I'm not free to listen to jokes right now 
All hail Britannia 
Zero How lucky 
Don't tell me it's Orange kun 
I understand 
All hail Britannia A failure like this 
How am I going to answer my master 
Only his emotions have gone out of control 
Don't be a nuisance Zero 
right right 
How can that be possible You know it too

Be careful 
I understand 
It's nimble 
Thank goodness Minami 
What happened to Ohgi 
He was shot 
the culprit is still I understand 
Hurry up and confirm it 
She's inside the clubhouse 
We have split up for a while I understand 
where are you right now 
I'm your accomplice 
I'm your ally 
You want me to believe that 
everything you say is for your own convenience 
Concentrate fire and finish him off Understood 
Target acquired Fire 
2500 }I see it 
W What the heck is that 
Zero Zero 
I don't have time to mess around with you 
Everything you say is for your own convenience 
You missed 
outdated fool 
All right

what should we do with these fellows 
Zero will definitely protect us 
It'll be weird if he doesn't 
Everything up till now has been 
Shut up 
I'm the one who knows Zero the best 
He wouldn't hesitate at a time like this

What we want is that white armor of yours 
Arthur This damn cat 
Finish all of them off Good evening 
Retreat

You are now a knight in name and in reality 
Kururugi Suzaku 
Your Highness 
Eh 
Zero is gone 
Yes 
Why at such an important time 
Where the heck is Zero 
I don't know We can't contact him

There must be a reason behind his actions 
Go and help him 
But how do I find him 
You should be able to see him soon Right 
That is The Lancelot 
Understood 
Hand the flight unit we captured over to me

But 
I what do you mean by explode 
Tell me Princess Euphemia's revenge 
Where is Zero

Persistent bastard 
My wonderful revenge

Defend this place even till death 
Have you really abandoned us 
Abandoned Japan

Le Lelouch is I'm Zero

That was why I always denied it

People

Monggo mirsani 
Sir it's time

He sought refuge from the storm 
As a reward he offers a rose to the Prince 
Because of the beauty indeed there is in him 
Small town Quiet village

Waking up to say:

To be our guest      lf you stress 
We recommend a good dinner 
Be our guest be our guest Be our guest 
Life is very debilitating 
To the waiter who did not serve 
He's not himself without a soul to wait 
Suddenly an enjoyable day was lost 
We've rusted too long 
Need more than to clean dust 
More often we lazing in the palace 
With dessert she wants tea 
And I do not mind my dear 
We have much to do 
You want one or two of sugar 
For you our guest     He is our guest 
He is our guest 
Be our guest 
Our command is your request 
With your food with your comfortability

Be our guest     Be our guest 
Please be our guests 
Pudding 
Why are you nice to me 
You never want to go 
Tuan was not as bad as it looks 
Someone is waiting to be unleashed 
Go to sleep dear Good night 
Good night 
Directly to the room 
You do not realize what can you do 
You can harm us all 
Go away from here 
Go 
Wait You cheated again 
Miss what are you doing 
Go away from here Stop 
Froufrou stop him 
Catch him 
Come on 
Do not get out 
Do not Dog silly 
Naughty dog bad dog 
Do not 
Please do not go 
That is dangerous 
Yikes 
You have to help 
You have to stand 
I'm sure this is the way 
Simply we have to go back 
Stop 
There he is 
There he is 
That tree 
But now the tree 
Stand back again because 
Magic or the other 
Do you want to marry into this family 
No 
That way 
Certainly 
It's enough you play us 
Where is Belle 
The ugly kidnapped her 
The creature was not real 
Or cup speak 
Or magic 
Inhale Gaston 
Why do not we just go back to the village 
Why are you offering to help us 
Because he was not my biological daughter 
Let us go home 
Belle was not at home 
He shared Say it again 
Then I'll make you a wolf food 
Gaston Stop 
Think about things that are fun 
Remember back during the war 
Imagine about the explosion 
 
Correct imagine 
Correct 
Maurice 
Please forgive me 
Father in law 
I might have guessed it 
Sick 
If you can be quiet it will not be too sore 
If you did not run this will not happen 
If you do not scare me I'm not going to run 
You should rest 
Thank you 
We are very grateful 
Why are you so concerned about her 
We have maintained for a long time 
You are right 
SONG: 
Days ln The Sun   days when life begins 
Not until my day ends 
What you'll always be 
Can not my flailing 
Oh no 
Can love and hope to survive 
For I was naive and unsure 
But now I'm wiser and wondered 
Wonderful days it will come back 
The furniture is rarely used 
Trash We become garbage I want to help you 
There must be a way to break the curse 
There is one way 
You do not have to think about it 
You know Shakespeare 
My education is quite high 
Romeo and Juliet is my favorite 
I'm not surprised 
She let her heart melt and 
You'd better read another 
Like what 
You can start reading all that is here 
You're going to do it 
Yes I think so 
If you really like it then all of it is yours 
Not all 
Some of them speak Greek Are you kidding me 
Can you kidding me right now 
Maybe 
The air is so blue and clear and cold 
Frozen in thin sheets 
Rolled stems and twigs 
Each foliage in a blanket by glass 
I feel like I've seen this 
Look at me 
Come and wake me up 
SONG: 
something THERE   There is a sweet and good 
But he was nasty and rude 
He glanced over here I think I see 
New and makes me uneasy 
Who would have thought this could happen 
True he is not a handsome prince 
Who would have thought     Bless my soul 
We pay attention to a few days away 
What Mom 
What is that 
What are you reading 
lt is nothing I guess Lancelot 
Nonetheless 
You know how to enjoy life 
When I walked into the room and laughing 
I also 
The villagers told me a strange girl 
I do not know they are praising or insulting 
Your village does not seem good 
It was a gift from the witch 
Books that can help you escape 
Awesome This game is the most violent 
Almost like a curse 
But you can 
Think of a place you want to visit 
Where is this 
Paris 
Oh I remember Paris 
What do you want to see first 
Rotterdam 
SONG: 
Once this is my life boundary 
At the top of a rickety and dusty attic is 
Easy to remember 
Difficult to forget 
Has gone 
What happened to your mother He never told me 
Mask doctor 
We have to go now 
Let us go home 
It sucks 
You know not too late to go back 
Gaston 
You're trying to kill Maurice 
Maurice 
Fortunately 
You left me with a herd of wolves 
Wolf 
Maurice do you have proof 
Tanya Agathe he saved me 
Sorry Agathe 
Mr LeFou 
He was there 
She saw everything I 
You are right 
Do not joke 
That question is quite difficult 
He did not try to kill Maurice 
Basic you Maurice 
That is why Belle run 
You need help 
Everything will be alright 
I saw her in the ballroom and said 
I did not think he would say yes 
No sir It was perfect 
You must tell your feelings to her 
I feel stupid 
He might not love me 
Do not be discouraged 
He is Stop saying that 
No way we are united 
You care about him is not it 
Then with romantic music and candles 
True and when the time is right 
How could I know 
Do not worry sir You'll be fine 
ln the dark 
Full dust Dark and very dusty 
Starting from his hair comb his hair 
I'll take care of her nails 
I'll brush her teeth 
Rub her nails Polishing horns 
OK I can clean up this 
Oh beautiful 
Beauty and the Beast story of the ancient 
What is the real 
But not friends fall in love 
Without the suspect 
Only a few changes 
Both Little change slightly scared 
Both were not ready 
The beauty and the Beast 
Always the same 
Always surprising 
Same as previous    Always confident 
As the sun always rises 
The story of the ancient 
The music is old fashioned 
Be aware that you're wrong 
As Like the sun 
Rhythms ancient song 
The beauty and the Beast 
The beauty and the Beast 
After all this time I almost forgot the taste 
This seems stupid 
l do not know 
Do you think you will be happy here 
Whether a person can be happy without freedom 
My father taught me how to dance 
I often stepped on his foot 
You must miss him 
Very 
You want to see him 
I want to see my father 
Father 
What did they do to him 
He is in danger 
Then you have to get there 
What are you saying 
You've got to save 
Bring it 
So you have a way to see me 
I let it go 
What 
Sir why did you do it 
I must 
But why 
Because he loves her 
So why do we not change 
Because Belle does not love him 
Now it's too late But he might come back 
No 
I released him 
I hope I can do the same thing to you 
Go 
Our time is running out 
Go on my love 
I who have myself 
I am the master of my faith 
I never needed anybody in my life 
I learned today 
I'll never feel the pain 
I closed my eyes but he's still there 
More than me 
Now I know you never feel it 
Although he escaped 
Waiting for my loneliness 
Waiting at the end of the open door 
I feel myself to appear in front of him 
And along with me forever more 
I'm ready to fight a crazy court 
I hit the light is blurred 
He is already in reach 
He was never far outside 
And I knew he would never see me 
Although he felt guilt 
He's still inside me 
He taught everything I do 
I walked right in front of him 
I think it could be waiting here forever more 
Exempt queen please 
He was in the hospital 
Not in silence 
You would not last a week 
Stop 
Pa 
Oh boy l thought I lost you 
Let her go 
Please release him 
My father was not crazy 
Gaston Tell him 
That's right Bell 
He discusses about a monster in the palace 
You want proof 
Show me the monster that to me 
That's the proof 
It's unbelievable 
See the monster 
Look at this 
Here 
Gosh 
Do not be afraid 
She is gentle and kind 
It smelled like a monster 
If I do not know right or bad 
You're the monster 
Monster was not going to hurt anyone 
This rift in our great justice 
Yes Do something 
Get him No 
You're not going to get away with this Gaston 
Gaston 
You want to be next That's what I said 
Yes 
We kill that monster 
Kill the monster Kill him 
He will attack our village do not let him free 
It is now time for action everything 
Now it's time to follow 
And it was most encouraging Save them 
He's a monster he's got fangs 
Sharp Large claw claw killer for a party 
Hear him roar see the foam 
Kill the monster 
Put your courage in place 
Call it war call it a threat 
Running clay no question 
Calculate Hold your sword Hold thine 
Praise the Lord and here we come 
Show me the palace 
At least they finally learn to love 
In other words they do not have love 
It's the first time for me I was being rude 
you hear that is it painful is he back 
I told you 
Lots of infidels 
We fight them 
This is it 
That is true love 
Prepare mortar and step aside 
and not afraid of the dangers that come 
We came to fight 
Come on we need help 
We must help the monster 
He let me go 
He released me to see you 
I do not understand 
I know what happened to my mother 
Then you know why I have to keep it secret 
Possible excessive 
I understand 
This is dangerous 
Yes 
I could try to damage the lock 
The key is to me this Padlock 
You need something sharp 
Like that 
Perfect 
No they were behind the door 
It is okay 
Let them enter 
Kill the monster 
Kill the monster 
lt did not work l know 
Kill the monster Kill the monster

You smell very fragrant 
All turned to humans 
You are there 
You changed 
Henry

Oh I'm so lonely 
To become an hour 
To become an hour 
See 
Oh prince Hello old friend 
She was the queen 
The oldest fairy tales 
Papa 
Hunger turned into a party 
Nothing could be delivered 
I do not know 
Certain as the sun 
Rises in the east 
Beauty and the Monster 
The oldest fairy tales The oldest song rhyme 
Beauty and the Monster 
Water 
Water is 
Water is life 
Water is life 
Water is the most important thing 
The whole world is 70% water 
We animals everything 70% water 
Water is always at the core of his work 
For me water is the most important capital 
70% of the work is done 
As a consultant in many countries 
The soil is drying out 
And the heavy rains come anyway 
What happens then 
But this layer has been eroded away 
How can I build a lake here 
Anywhere on earth 
This water barrier is the core of the dam 
Of course 
and thus is naturally purified 
Ask nature think with her and not against her 
Did you find something out 
Nothing in particular 
I can't understand that 
But I'm surprised 
Charles was 
No He left the investigation to us 
l see 
What exactly is this Sasaki Academy 
So are you also a mutant 
No 
ln that case why 
So you shut it down 
Good friends 
Dr Sasaki do you remember him 
Doctor 
It's almost time for the meeting 
Jun Sanada and Riko Nirasaki 
And these are the X Men 
That's everyone 
Yes 
Go ahead 
Excuse me 
The weather appears to be clearing 
Yes 
l'll go too 
l'm coming too 
You talk to Hisako and Emma 
However 
Understood 
The main equipment is underground 
A boy 
Younger than me 
Hisako 
You used to go to an ordinary school right 
Maybe that boy was a friend of yours at school 
Maybe 
By the way Yui 
Aren't you an acquaintance of Professor X 
More than 15 years ago 
But we were never close 
I feel like Dr Sasaki's changed 
Changed 
Yeah She used to be kinder and warmer I think 
She still seems kind at least to me 
That's true but 
Yui Sasaki is lying 
But she has seen him since then 
Did you read her mind 
No I didn't use telepathy 
This is a woman's intuition right 
A woman's intuition 
Even though they weren't that close 
A deeper level 
All right let's pull it out 
That's impossible 
I'm joking 
Storm 
Could you melt all this ice 
That's also impossible Look at this snow 
I wonder if you could even call it snow 
At first glance it seems like snow but 
It doesn't melt It's not even cold 
It seems more like a mineral 
So in Japan they have diamond or ruby snow 
Of course not 
It's as ifjust this place was suddenly changed 
Yui Sasaki 
Yes I thought I'd let you know just in case 
Thank you 
It's been a while 
I wasn't expecting you to contact me 
I hear you've shut down the Academy 
Are you saying the X Men are in the way 
I have nothing to do with it 
I saw you and a boy 
Does that boy have anything to do with you 
Why did he enter my mind 
Answer me Yui 
That boy is probably Takeo 
Takeo 
He's my son Mine 
And yours 
Our son 
You're telling me I have a son 
So then that was 
My son entered my consciousness 
That is incorrect 
But I'm certain I met that boy 
What does that mean 
Do you mean our son is dead 
Someday I'll tell you everything 
But for now please stop meddling in my affairs 
Staying here is pointless 
An avalanche 
Doesn't seem like it 
is a mountain monster making snowmen or 
What on earth is that 
It seems that snowman has business with us 
So let's go say hello 
Wait 
What's that 
Storm 
There's one here too 
How do you like Japan 
Sorry but I haven't seen any Kabuki yet 
What are you 
Some kind of hedgehog monster 
Beast 
Did you pulverize him 
There was no resistance 
You are pretty tough 
It's about time 
What 
So that was the aim of the attack just now 
The greetings are finished Let's meet again 
I see He can liquefy his body 
That's why he offered no resistance 
This is no time for analysis 
Let's get out of here 
Jun 
I'm going to take my shot in my room 
Be careful 
l understand 
Hisako 
is something wrong with your right hand 
The bruise on my hand is hurting 
Bruise 
It used to be bigger 
Do you remember an injury or a burn 
No 
It suddenly started hurting when I got here 
Has it ever hurt you like this before 
l don't think so 
I 
l'm going to ask Dr Sasaki for an ointment 
Hey 
She told us to use the intercom remember 
But 
Talk 
You want me to let you read my mind 
Yes 
What for 
To remove your hesitation 
My hesitation 
is it because of Jean 
So what is making you suffer 
Hisako also asked me Help him she said 
It's none of her business 
She's worried about you in her own way 
At this rate it may impede our work as X Men 
Face your heart 
I'm sure Jean would wish for that too 
l don't like this 
What's wrong 
But I can still smell someone else in there 
Indeed She doesn't seem to want us there 
Seems we'd better keep an eye on Yui Sasaki 
That's why I asked Scott and Emma to stay 
I want to become that light 
I'm begging you Scott kill me 
You know I couId never do thatI 
You 
What did you do to Jean's heart 
I love you Scott 
Jean 
You are 
Now you die too 
Scott 
Dr Sasaki 
Feeling better 
Yeah 
And you as well 
Listen to me Scott 
You need a stronger heart than anyone else 
Don't let Jean's will go to waste 
I want to become that light And I 
So now you want to coach me just like Hisako 
A new facet of the case is revealed

Like a five year old please 
Dirty tricks 
Not really new news 
Why would they want to kill us 
One of you tipped off the authorities in the UK 
A contact inside Customs and Excise 
So now they have to take you out 
No this this is crazy 
I mean 
This goes higher than us 
This kind of thing brings down governments 
Iran Contra anyone 
And do 
That's who shot at us 
The CIA 
No 
They'd have tasked local contractors 
So nothing can be linked back to them 
You got lucky 
But this isn't going to go away 
OK let's get practical then 
So what are the options 
Well there must be something 
Right 
Like this minute 
Excuse us for the inconvenience

Take you to another country 
New identities

I feel like I recognize her 
I told you this was a mistake 
That's all we had man That's all we had 
Does anyone recognize this 
We found Johnny's shirt 
And it was full of food from the shed 
I get what it looks like I see that 
Someone framed me 
I don't know who did it 
I don't really need them anyways 
You know obviously I can take care of myself 
Took them how long to build a fire 
I did it in five minutes in the dark 
I can't believe 
Johnny's gonna just stay out in the woods 
That's crazy 
And why shouldn't he 
After all the crap that he's pulled 
He'll be fine 
And you can keep his bed 
Can I tell you something 
Sure 
You're a smart guy 
He plays game for living 
Have you ever thought about it 
I don't think you should trust him 
Can't trust anybody 
Guys 
I get up early and as soon as I open the door 
It felt like a threat 
Let me see 
What does it say 
It says 
What is that 
It means get out 
It's a nice prop Look at it 
It's not real Nice scare tactic 
They're watching I'm sure they're loving this 
Why is it in front of our cabin and not yours 
Who wants you guys to get out 
Well this is here on purpose That's for sure 
It's here on purpose It's here for a reason 
Who else could've left that spear 
Besides Production who could've done it 
We're the only people out here

Johnny doesn't know anything 
He doesn't remember anything 
It was just her and him in the forest 
I know that I know that 
I saw it in his eyes okay 
All I remember is I talked to her 
We were arguing 
When I saw that look in his eyes 
I just felt that I needed to take a step back 
Remember the way she came into camp 
He's got the same look on his face 
Does she remember anything 
Show us your hands 
Oh yeah I've seen that before 
What's that from 
Nothing's making sense here 
We can't go killing each other 
We're still human beings 
We're talking supernatural stuff now 
I've never hit a woman in my life 
I don't know why I would 
I don't remember anything but 
I can't say that I didn't 'cause I don't 
I don't know what happened 
But I know in my heart I wouldn't do that 
I don't remember anything 
All I remember is that I was with 
Went to get Johnny 
He was in the woods I found him and I 
It's all one big blur like one big blackout 
I don't understand 
So you're telling me this is real 
Yes 
It looks like it's native handmade 
It looks like it's just a prop to me 
This is ox 
It's real ox 
And it's balanced for throwing 
It just looks perfect 
I have to know the environment I'm in 
Look at this 
So I found this symbol that is really strange 
I should follow them 
At the end it was very close to the settlement 
I found the last one 
And I found this box It was a metal box 
I opened it and it was a book 
It was a person He's staring at me 
And he just disappeared in a second 
So there are people out there 
Hey 
I just thought 
So I kissed her 
Don't worry about it 
Hey 
Hey 
Can I have a seat 
How are you feeling 
I'm okay You 
Do you remember anything from last night 
No I don't remember a thing

To President Joo 
I'm just a crazy woman 
Thanks for everything today 
Who is that man 
And he lives in Room 404 
Yeah 
Does that man know about your mental state 
Gong Shil 
My energy 
You see it all the time in period dramas 
Maybe you're right 
That man Who would that be 
There's just someone 
Whoever it is just let him give it to you 
Suck him of his energy okay 
Let's suck on 404's energy for now 
Hurry up and go to sleep 
Is something in here right now 
Our summer revenue figures are doing great

This store has the highest revenue volume 
President Joo 
Hello thank you for all your hard work 
Yes 
Look at how fierce it looks 
We've already paid her for the modeling fee 
I like it 
She said this was the place 
Yes I know 
Look into him some more 
Look into it 
I heard that he was so devoted to his wife 
That's too bad 
I've seen that couple too 
The husband seemed so kind 
I heard that his mother in law is even richer 
He's hit the jackpot 
Awesome He's hit the mother load 
So I guess he deserves the money 
Gong Shil 
Did you did you see something again 
No 
Gong Shil 
And you can receive his energy too 
Okay 
I'm sorry Gong Ri I'm going to get going 
Bye

This is my wife's shoe 
And that woman is in here right now 
Who are you

Lady what are you doing

You told me that Hee Joo is around me 
Yes

I wonder if I'm just tired 
Why does my head hurt so badly

Cha Hee Joo 
Are you hesitating right now 
Joo Joong Won are you angry 
Joo Joong One 
Joo Joong Two 
Joo Joong Three 
It's not the least bit funny 
Bitch 
It's that woman 
I told him that I'd get him to meet her again 
And what else she may know 
Tae Gong Shil 
Why are you here 
How did you find out where I live 
Didn't I warn you Did I not tell you to stop 
Joong Won

You

The bitch you hate 
Thank you 
Sorry I have to keep holding on to feel calm 
Let's go 
Is this far enough 
Yes 
Is this far enough 
I don't think a ghost followed me 
There aren't any 
Then why are you still holding on 
My hand just keeps going towards your body 
Of course 
You're a very expensive man 
Thank you so much for helping me 
I'm valued at a very high cost 
So be careful 
Then there will be serious consequences 
Yes I'm sorry 
I was just trying to make you feel comfortable 
Don't bother 
I understand 
I went overboard 
Really 
I've always gotten fired because of the ghosts 
I never thought I'd find work again 
Thank you President Joo 
Yes I'll do well 
Holding hands is 100 000 won 
Hugging is 1 000 000 won 
I took it all out from your salary 
Wait I think that's too much 
100 000 won 
I won't touch you so carelessly 
I'm warning you to be careful 
I understand 
So expensive 
Doesn't matter if you're uncomfortable 
The truth is you need me 
No matter how expensive my body can protect you 
But if you put it that way you need me too 
That's right I do need you 
That's right 
You feel like you'd die without me right 
Without you 
I'd feel inconvenienced 
Then hear me out 
Get lost 
If I were kidding you would be laughing 
100 000 won 
Not even worth a bottle of champagne 
1 000 000 won 
I was too cheap 
Was President Joo here 
He was so cool before 
Hey come to your senses 
He didn't hug you because he liked you 
He was making the ghosts go away 
Okay Today I'll hug you a lot 
1 000 000 won 
2 000 000 won 
I love you 
Hey ghost go away 
Like it 
Episode 5 
We found the perfect wife for your grandson 
How old is she 
Is she about Ji Woo's age 
She's the same age as Ji Woo 
And she died at the same age as Ji Woo 
I prepared these for Ji Woo's wedding 
I can feel that Ji Woo's soul is near 
Ji Woo 
Kang Woo 
They delivered milk 
Are you going to have one 
You guys can have it 
Thanks 
She just left 
A job 
You should protect her 
What kind of people 
You'll know when you see her later 
Be brave and don't run away 
Protect Gong Shil 
You said you like her 
I like her but she doesn't like me 
Keep on drinking 
Drink 
Go away Stop following me 
Let me live Stop bothering me

Who is it 
Did he go this way 
Oh no 
I'll buy you coffee Come back later 
Kang Woo 
Kang Woo 
Kang Woo 
I think I lost him Who was it 
Was it a thief 
It's not a big deal Don't worry about it 
Well it's sort of true 
I did think something was strange 
Gong Shil by any chance are you in debt 
Are the people following you around loan sharks 
No 
Then what is it 
There's one right next to you now 
Kang Woo 
What's bothering you 
He's a ghost a ghost like stalker 
Stalker 
He keeps following me around and bothering me 
Have you reported him 
Should we go to the police station 
No I don't want to go to the police 
Then should I help you out 
I know how to get rid of stalkers 
Are you saying you'll be my bodyguard 
I'm pretty good though 
I won't charge you 
Then can I depend on you 
It's Ms Tae 
Looks like Kang Woo is with her 
He trusted me with a very important job 
Are you helping him with something personal 
What kind of work 
Well the thing is 
So 
Hello President Joo 
Tae Gong Shil You're as fast as a ghost 
Secretary 
Who 
You 
According to who 
Did Mr Kim say so 
I didn't say anything to her 
Aren't I working here as your secretary 
This is not where you'll be 
Then where will I be 
This is the place 
But this is a storage room 
So now we use it as storage 
What will be my responsibilities 
Really 
But it suits her just fine 
'Advisor for Special Customer Services' 
How can I advise any customers here 
Why is my first customer a ghost 
I said I'd get you coffee 
Do you know that woman 
Dead people 
Marriages for the dead spirits 
Wealthy families sure do strange things 
I hear you got a room for Bang Shil 
Where is it 
We got her an office not a room 
And it's Gong Shil not Bang Shil 
I love you 
Center for special customer services 
There's such a department at Kingdom 
There is 
Anyway good for you 
It'll be bad if weird things visit you there 
It's already here 
It is 
One for you 
One for him 
He's my first customer 
He likes it here 
I'll go now You should visit 
Hey 
Now what 
Tell me How did someone as young as you die 
Tell me 
Someone who has one foot in the spirit world 
This lady will do 
We also exchanged information 
Mrs Wang of the Shanghai distribution 
Is he trying to build a lie 
But still it would be worth looking into 
Mrs Wang could be Kingdom's VIP member 
Someone had paid her a visit already 
Just letting you know Not bad right 
Your aunt stopped by to ask me for a favor 
Work 
She said to go visit Chairman Wang 
What if you see him there 
Do you think so 
Then I don't think I can go 
No if you see him there go meet him 
What 
Ask him about his grandmother's business plans 
But I'm scared 
Is President Wang an important person 
Very important 
Ask her no matter what 
Since she's important to you I'll go 
You have me to protect you 
Do well If you're scared I'll hold you 
Madam This is the lady 
Can you please change into these clothes 
You want me to wear this 
It's a favor 
She's definitely not normal 
I didn't give her extra work 
Madam Go 
What rumor 
This is amusing Ghost rumors 
President Joo 
Are you okay 
What did you see there 
Oh her dead grandson 
I think he's inside this house 
He never go to be in love 
What are you doing there 
Clothes 
Why'd they ask you to do that 
A what 
Why would you wear that 
Take it off and get out of there 
Why 
Get out Right now 
But you said it was important 
I'll see what I can do before I leave 
Tae Gong Shil Tae Gong Shil 
Whatever She's not a real employee anyway 
Since it's important to you I'll go 
She should get out if she's afraid of ghosts 
Why is she doing everything I ask her to do 
Whatever Whatever 
I think it was here 
Is this the dead grandson's room 
It's locked 
Please open Please open 
Please spend the night in this room 
Who are you 
Please open the door 
Ma'am we have a visitor 
What are you doing here President Joo 
Where is she 
I invited her here to ask her for a favor 
Who is she with 
Is it your dead grandson 
It's something important to me Get out 
She's an important employee I'll stick around 
Where is she 
What 
I said where is she 
Open it 
I said open it 
Open it 
Open it for him 
You'll regret it if you open it 
Your financial advisor paid me a visit 
I can join forces with you 
Then I will 
President Joo 
Go back in 
I'm here 
President Joo you're here 
She opened the door 
I didn't 
It's all ruined Ma'am 
Ma'am your grandson has a message for you 
My Ji Woo 
I'll just say it verbatim 
Grandma are you senile 
Just stop it 
It's my Ji Woo 
Who 
There's someone 
Explode like the fire from the propane 
Raise it Raise it up 
As if you're the fireworks 
Passionately 
Like it's consuming your body 
Raise your dress up Raise it up 
Raise it up 
Way up 
Stretch it up 
I'm not doing this 
Wait a minute 
How much left 
Just one more scene 
What 
My arm is about to fall off 
I'm only going to hold the lid 
Miss Yi Ryung 
My friend 
Didn't I tell you 
I meant to tell you 
She works at Kingdom now 
Is it Tae Gong Shil by any chance 
So it was Tae Gong Shil 
All the misfortune was blamed on Ji Woo 
Everyone has a sick person in the family 
How did it become all about ghosts 
Because of that 
It's because of that 
He's waiting for someone he likes 
That never even crossed my mind 
He was sick since he was a child 
This is too hot 
That child had this girl that he liked 
I want to meet her for once as well 
You will be able to meet her 
Right 
I don't know I only know this kind of person 
Not at all 
The only thing important to me is you Ma'am 
Then I will consider it 
Our team will 
Miss 
The kid who came to deliver milk 
I didn't know who he was 
Did you find out who it is 
I think so 
It's not a girl 
It's a guy 
I think he's waiting for the milkman 
A guy 
Miss 
Did you figure something out 
Yes well 
No Ma'am She says she still doesn't know 
We will come back tomorrow 
Let's go 
President Joo 
How can you just leave 
She's waiting shouldn't we let her meet him 
So what are you going to do 
But that's a lie 
You said you didn't like lying yourself 
That kid is so pitiful 
But I'll do what you say 
Make a decision 
Go 
Find the milkman 
Tae Gong Shil come fast 
I will crush you 
Are you the stalker 
What is this 
Tae Yi Ryung you again 
Get off you jerk 
There's no scratch 
It's going to swell up 
I didn't come to vent out but to take revenge 
What are you going to do 
The guy 
President Joo 
You don't think I'll be able to do it 
I'm Tae Yi Ryung 
Should I do that 
You're going to help me 
But there's a condition 
Why are you curious about that 
Do you perhaps like Tae Gong Shil 
Well let's say I do 
Wait I think it's turning blue 
Hey Why are you talking down to me 
I could just tell you look younger than me 
You sure do look older than me 
Want me to treat you like an old person 
Fine Talk in that familiar form 
Drink by yourself 
It's that guy from before 
Excuse me I'd like to ask you something 
The person's over there 
It looks like him 
He looks sturdy 
Excuse me 
Yes 
You know Ji Woo right 
Ji Woo 
He said it was a guy 
She's the one right 
Hey delivery 
Shouldn't you deliver it properly 
The milk is all squashed 
I don't like being unlucky either 
Just like you 
What 
What are you doing 
It's fortunate 
That she's a girl how fortunate 
I am aware of what happened to Ji Woo 
There's something we really wanted to show you 
It'll be great if you can go and take a look 
It's a very pretty flower A green rose 
Then are there green roses as well 
I like the color green 
We do have green roses 
Awesome they must be pretty 
If I grow out my hair and doll up I'm fine too 
Why do you keep saying I'm ugly 
I think being weak is girly 
Hey 
Don't cry 
If you cry you'll get uglier 
I really don't like guys like you 
Ji Woo 
Ji Woo 
They're very pretty 
You lied saying they were ugly 
I wanted to show you too so I grew out my hair 
But you died like a fool 
Farewell 
Farewell my baby 
Farewell 
So I'll drive you home today Oh no 
Kang Woo has a lot of interest in me 
He's really curious about what I do next to you 
It's a bit awkward to give him an answer 
I told him that it was a stalker 
So he said he'll be my bodyguard 
Are you perhaps bragging right now 
It's all thanks to you President Joo 
Going to work and meeting people Stop the car 
I could go a little further 
No I don't want to go any further 
Get lost here Okay 
Well then 
What the heck 
Then goodbye 
Let's go 
Why is that 
Miss Come with us What are you doing 
Who are you 
Let's go 
Kang Woo Are you okay 
Are those people the ones following you around 
They're people but why did they follow me 
That's enough 
You shine too brightly 
I shine brightly 
They may complain and make a request 
You must be alert 
The chance to come back by using you 
Be careful and don't get swallowed 
Mom said she was coming now 
Seung Joon didn't you hear what I said 
Seung Joon 
Seung Joon 
Seung Joon 
Seung Joon where are you 
Seung Joon 
Seung Joon 
You have to tell me where you're going 
It's a doll 
You can't 
We don't know if someone left it there 
Let's go 
How did you meet that swindler 
While working 
You're not explaining in detail once again 
Anyway it was worth waiting over there 
Do you really like me 
They might run away if they find out 
Is she perhaps a spy A criminal 
Or is originally a man 
Various things come to mind right 
I warned you 
Don't come any closer 
Thank you so much for today 
Don't say thank you 
It just makes me feel bad 
You're not the only one who has a secret 
There could be something I'm not saying as well 
After listening to your warning 
Sleep tight 
Kang Woo I see ghosts 
How can I say this 
It's an innate choice 
So 
Are you going 
I can't You're here 
It's too bad but I declined 
So is that why you don't have any strength 
That was very regretful 
And what is that 
The person who likes me 
Thank you 
Thanks Hold onto your mom's hand well 
Thank you 
Come this way please 
I can't say that I can see ghosts 
But I'm so depressed 
Why do I have to see ghosts 
Tae Gong Shil 
Probably think it's because you're arrogant 
I'm so funny right 
It's because I have some room to breathe 
So I have a lot of time to think about things 
I got greedy too 
Humans want more if they can live 
That can happen 
Thank you President Joo 
You have become an air defense for me 
And a counseling room as well 
So I'll give you a discount 
Thank you 
Can you tag along when I go home 
That cannot happen 
Okay 
What's the occasion There wasn't enough 
But you know Tae Gong Shil who worked with us 
President Joo 
They're that close 
President Joo should probably hear it by now 
We have to connect like 
Didn't Gong Shil have a lover She did 
A lover 
Then it's a love triangle 
Who is it 
The security team 
Hey 
Not only that he's also her personal bodyguard 
Really 
Tae Gong Shil is trash 
Right 
Possessing the mind is the way to seduce them 
In that Loreley Hill myth men jumped in to die 
Anyways who is that guy 
It's me Pardon 
The one preparing to dive on the hill is me 
It's not easy jumping in 
I would need to brave 
You would need enforcements 
What is trash 
Sorry 
This is a storage house 
Tae Gong Shil 
Mr Kim 
Yes 
Yes Sir 
I want to know you 
So you should cheer up 
President Joo 
He told me to cheer up 
And 
So you're going to cheer up and go Yes 
I want to try to go 
I want to go 
♫ Are you listening to my heart 
♫ 
♫ In this world there is only one ♫ 
Right 
♫ Why are you always pulling away from me ♫ 
You know that can't be 
♫ Please take my hand ♫ 
I too am not indifferent 
So do you feel just a tiny bit 
I always felt a little like that 
You tend to touch me too randomly 
When you use me as your secret hideout 
I would like it to be at a friendly level 
This Friendly 
I understand 
But now I think I should be careful 
Careful careful 
Yes Be careful 
Be careful of things like this too 
This kind of concern is friendly 
Understand 
Yes 
Now let's go I'll take you 
It's okay I'll just go on my own 
That much concern I can give you 
Let's go 
But I need to be careful 
My radar just caught a strange thing 
So hold it Use it 
It's fine 
You again 
I'm just being careful 
I have nothing to be careful about 
Don't worry and just come 
Even Kang Candy will take you more seriously 
Episode 8 
I let it slip due to a personal feeling 
I'm sorry 
Cha Hee Joo was an orphan 
I'll look into it 
One more thing 
Yes 
Are you alright 
I will be 
Will it hurt 
I will take care of it 
Mr CEO 
I'm grateful for today

So I think I just need to talk it out with it 
You can go now 
Go

Does this look like tofu 
Ah it's salty 
Are you here again Super Market Grandma 
 
How can I sleep if you stare at me like that 
Stop stop please stop 
You can stop now grandmother 
Stop just stop 
CEO Joo 
Have a seat 
I was really surprised 
I too was quite shocked 
That's something to be more surprised about 
Are things about me being reported there too 
Right dear 
Of course 
I don't know 
So come out of the garbage bins 
Don't do that with your eyes Grandma 
Just come out 
Kang Woo 
Are you planning to go out for a run this late 
Yes I'm going out for a short run 
I just came on my own so I'm sorry 
Something unexpected came up so 
Tae Gong Shil 
What 
I couldn't say it wasn't true 
I'm sorry 
Ah it was like that 
No wonder I thought it was quite strange 
How embarrassing 
the pain will tell you the answer 
I don't think you were hurt because of me 
♫ How much time has to pass for you to love me 
♫ My heart hurts 
It hurts more today than it did yesterday 
You need to go get it 
I won't tolerate that 
Help 
Over here 
Someone please help

I'll install my radar at the pool 
Giant Mall building is taller than mine 
Secretary Kim 
Hi 10 billion won radar 
We need to run the radar 
You were you harassed all night 
Mr CEO do I 
look sick 
You always look sick 
Yes 
Water ghost 
I never want to see a water ghost again 
Never ever 
I really hate water ghosts 
I hate them so much 
They're too scary 
Hold it 
Water ghosts 
She shudders at the thought of them 
I feel bad just sending her to catch them 
Isn't this place a really awesome place 
Earlier he said I looked like a zombie 
Is he sending me there so I can get some rest 
Yes yes 
Oh I'm so happy 
Yes 
Yes 
Then should we ask Apt 404 
No 
No 
Well then let's just pack our suitcase 
Gong Shil I'm so happy 
Hey Kingdom Hotel has a pool right 
Let's pack our swimsuits as well 
There is no such thing 
You dared to ask me to come and see you 
I'm not a person you can easily meet on a whim 
Thanks for coming in your busy schedule 
What is it that you wanted to ask me 
Why do you want to know about her family 
Do you want to marry her 
I could just meet her family in person 
Oh that's right 
Then is this just part of your job 
Keeping your eyes on her 
Are you going to help only if I dine with you 
No I don't mean that 
Call me after you've found out something 
Hey 
I already made reservations 
Why do you ask 
I'm sure he's doing it out of love 
That is even more ridiculous 
Did Tae Gong Shil leave 
Unnie this place is awesome 
Get here quickly 
Okay 
You don't need to know 
I'm a career woman 
I got something like this 
Bring Kang Woo and come 
You want us to join on Tae sisters' trip 
If they get together I'll buy you food 
Should I report this to the Vice President 
Let's just go have fun We have to 
They're doing fireworks today 
It's a pie in the sky for me 
Mr CEO 
Where are you 
Of course it is It's mine after all 
Mm it does look expensive 
Oh but how do you know where I am 
Because I'm behind you 
Mr CEO 
How did you come here 
I followed you 
Did you come alone 
My sister hasn't come yet 
Really 
Let's go eat first 
I'm hungry 
He followed me 
Why 
You have it ready right 
We can go after we eat dinner 
Where are we going 
I'll tell you after we eat 
She's so lucky 
Do you have anything you want to eat 
Tell me I'll buy it all for you 
Yes 
Then buy everything I want please 
Okay Let's go 
It's been 15 years since Hee Joo died 
Yes that's right 
Chief Kang Woo 
Why did he come here 
Secretary Kim what are you doing 
Ah yes I'm going 
Tae Gong Ri Tae Gong Shil 
Such sisters have never been at this orphanage 
You couldn't even bring money for gas 
Han Joo has small salary 
Oh 
It's Kim Dong Soo Do you know him 
Oh 
It's the same 
Who is he 
It's my neck 
But are you following him 
Hold on tightly 
You can't have alcohol so at least have this 
Thank you 
Really 
Just a minute 
Should I prepare it 
Wow whoever girl it's for is so lucky 
Event 
For me possibly 
You're going to go to your room right 
Meet me in two hours at the lobby 
We already ate Is there something else 
There's something very important 
Yes 
Then he closed the pool because of me 
Don't let anyone else enter after I go in 
Yes 
Yes 
What is this 
CEO Joo sent this 
It's so pretty 
It's pretty 
Mr CEO 
Did you prepare this for me 
Yes There's more 
Look 
♫ It's you 
♫ Love that's like destiny 
♫ Sad memories that were like shadows 
Please go in Mr CEO has been waiting for you 
Yes 
Yes 
It won't take long 
Yes 
Tae Gong Shil 
Tae Gong Shil where are you going 
Wait a minute 
♫ My heart that once was cold 
♫ Spreads with warmth 
But then why am I so upset 
♫ It's okay if I can't touch you 
♫ It's okay if I can't embrace you 
♫ La la la la la la la 
Is there anything else you need 
What 
Flowers champagne I'll prepare everything 
It's fine 
It seems she's mistaken about something 
Oh my 
What is it 
Looks like it's not an event 
You changed 
Yes I thought it would be uncomfortable 
You looked pretty earlier Let's go 
There isn't anything scary here 
There are people who are scarier than ghosts 
It can't be that way 
I don't care what they think 
Tae Gong Shil You're upset aren't you 
Yes 
That's right 
Of course I'd turn into Candy 
Forcing you when you said you didn't want to 
I felt guilty 
So it's like that 
I feel a little bit better now 
Let's go catch that water ghost 
Let's go 
It's okay now Mr CEO 
Let my hand go if you can 
I don't care 
Let's go 
That was fast 
I even recorded it Should I give it to you 
Send it to me Thanks a lot 
Hey 
Aren't you a singer 
You can find it all on the internet 
How long are you going to follow me 
Salary man you don't have a car right 
I'm going to take the subway 
That guy really 
Don't you see anything 
I don't see any 
Could it be in the water 
I'll go and look for it 
Wait for a while 
I should hurry and look 
Will you be alright 
Water ghosts are really scary 
You'll help me if I don't come up won't you 
Forget it Don't go 
Just go rest and watch the fireworks 
What about the water ghost 
You almost fell in 
There's an lady over there 
Oh it's scary 
This must be his house 
Kim Dong Soon you're dead today 
He's married 
Are you going to k ill 
I don't like her 
That's right 
Hasn't she lost almost all of her popularity 
Her popularity isn't like what it was before 
Let's get off at the next stop 
Hello I'm Tae Yi Reong 
Oh it's Tae Ri Yeong 
For your information I'm still very popular 
I really like you Oppa 
Thank you Thank you 
I love you so much 
Please look over here 
Why did you do that 
I was having fun 
You are really 
terrible at singing 
Really 
Even so I'm still pretty right 
You're saying that again 
Yup So I've decided 
Let's date 
I don't want to 
How can you refuse so quickly 
You dog mannered 
Hey 
It's Tae Ri Yeong Wow 
Oh really 
♫ It's okay even if I'm not able to touch you ♫ 
♫ It's okay even if I can't hug you ♫ 
♫ Yes I love you as I was destined to ♫ 
The water ghost is an older woman 
Yes 
Ah there she is 
Over there 
Yes What is she doing 
She's fixing her make up 
Make up 
Something seems really strange 
She's leaving 
Looks like she's not a water ghost 
Oh my 
What 
What 
She went over there 
What took so long 
That Ahjumma even took a shower 
Can there be such a polite ghost 
I don't think she knows she's dead 
Where is she now 
She's going up there 
She wasn't just staying at the pool 
She's wiping her mouth 
Looks like she's leaving 
To where again 
She's reading a magazine 
What is it 
She just went into that room 
Excuse me 
Yes 
Is there a guest in that room 
No that room is empty now 
Open it 
She's sitting over there 
She acts like she's alive 
Go 
Okay 
What did she say 
Did she understand 
She won a gift certificate to the hotel 
Is it her 
Yeah it is 
You're Mrs Kang Gil Ja right 
Come this way please 
This is really nice 
I wish I could always live in a place like this 
Dead 
Who 
Mrs Kang Gil Ja She's dead 
You say she's alive Where is she 
I heard she's at the hospital 
Is that even possible 
This is my first too I'm not really sure 
Why is she not waking up if she's fine 
What do you mean fine 
Why are you yelling 
You have no say 
You were the one that always fought against her 
But why isn't she waking up 
Ahjumma you can't stay here like this 
It looks like she doesn't want to go 
Before her daughter's name what was it 
Joo Yeon 
There's a response 
Your family is waiting 
You have to go live 
Do you want to go 
That's a good choice 
It's not even weird seeing her do that anymore 
Okay okay Okay Okay 
Looks like she's understanding well 
Ahjumma said she'll go 
She just wants to see the fireworks tonight 
I'll go watch it with her at the pool 
She already changed her clothes 
We'll be going 
Even a ghost is all dressed up and enjoying it 
Don't lose 
Should I enjoy it since it's the last time 
She must be really excited 
It probably will be pretty 
There are eyes 
Shall we go 
It was such a good dream 
I guess 
I'll have to wake up now 
Mom 
Honey 
Daughter are you okay 
Was it difficult 
Do you see me 
What should we do 
I'll listen to you so well from now on 
Mom really thank you 
Thank you 
Did Mrs Kang Gil Ja like it 
Yes 
She said she really liked it 
She said it was like a Midsummer Night's Dream 
Because she liked seeing it from here so much 
♫ You make me crazy ♪ 
♫ You make me cry ♪ 
She left 
Since when 
Just now 
Yes 
Fireworks are over 
I woke someone up from a good dream 
I didn't know he was married 
Hey 
You have a business trip to China scheduled 
How many days 
One week 
One week is a bit long 
Do I have to tell her 
Tae Yang already knows 
She seems fine even though she knows 
Tae Yang said this: 
I was concerned about it for no reason 
Are you not feeling fine 
I'm fine 
When your heart doesn't tell the truth 
pain gives the answer 
That's what Tae Yang said 
So apparently she found an answer 
I've heard that many times from someone 
Who 
Cha Hee Joo 
Are you saying you learn when you get hit 
That's right 
Yeah I want you to hurt a lot 
Where did you hear that from 
Did Hee Joo tell you 
I never saw Hee Joo 
I heard it from Kang Woo 
Bring me Kang Woo's résumé again 
Yes Oh by the way Mr CEO 
I saw Chief Kang Woo 
Is there a problem 
Who recommended you to him 
It was 
Was it my father 
Did you know 
I considered both sides 
You're the one that my father sent 
Why 
He said that a person related to 
Cha Hee Joo can come into contact with you 
Why 
Are his thoughts true 
Did you really not see the culprits 
You tell me honestly first 
Did you really give them my ransom 
Believe in what you want 
Tell him that 
Cha Hee Joo 
What's wrong 
Cha Hee Joo was here 
She told me about why she's a bad bitch 
That she's one of the main culprits 
Who did she say it was 
She told me she can't tell me 
What 
She said she has to protect that person 
Okay 
I want you to hurt a lot 
Tae Gong Shil 
Don't go Stay here 
I don't want her to see me like this 
♫ You make me cry ♫ 
I was going to get you a glass of water 
It is okay I don't need it 
I've been keeping watch but 
Cha Hee Joo isn't around you Mr CEO 
If she was alive I would have said so 
I would have tried until the end to get her 
I would have just hated her 
But she died right in front of my eyes 
I felt bad thinking about that too 
It must have been hard 
You said it was okay to worry and comfort 
Covering the wounds makes it hurt more 
I will make sure to curse at her 
If I meet her again I will definitely do so 
This b*tch 
I'm not a ten billion radar anymore 
I can't find where your money is 
That necklace is probably with the culprit 
I see that he doesn't want to trust me any more 
I should've moved more stealthily 
I am sorry 
I was planning to return to Korea anyways 
No Stay there until I return 
No I'm the one who provoked him first 
He'll just probably ignore everything 
I'll see you then Kang Woo 
I invited my friends to my birthday party 
All of them are coming 
Yes 
Yes 
Please appear again 
Please explain it to me 
He's having a hard time 
There will be no use for her anymore 
Since she came it has been loud around here 
It's going to be quiet again 
Did you hear from CEO Joo Joong Won about me 
Yes 
I had mistaken it as jealousy 
I am sorry 
Kang Woo I will tell you everything 
What are we looking for 
You can't see it Kang Woo 
So I'm just looking for a proper thing 
I can see ghosts 
You see dead people and talk to them 
You see that grandma 
She must have lost her precious cat 
There is a pretty white cat right next to her 
I don't see a cat or anything 
But I can see it 
Grandma did you ever take care of a cat 
I did but it died not too long ago 
Is she crying 
Was she sleeping 
I thought you were crying 
I guess her insides aren't rotten 
There 
Did something come 
When she's sleeping just leave her alone 
This is a safety hideout 
Where is it 
Get lost 
♫ When my fingertips brush you ♫ 
♫ Although I want to approach you secretly ♫ 
She is useful for other things 
♫ I can't even hug you ♫ 
♫ Yes I love you ♫ 
It's good isn't it 
I slept well 
You were there 
Why didn't you wake me up like you always do 
Alright 
Looks good Here 
Does he make you deliver now 
Ghosts must really like me 
Before the medium woman told me that 
I shine brightly to dead people 
Hey 
What's so good about being popular among ghosts 
Be careful don't get swallowed up 
What does she mean 'swallowed up' 
What 
It's no use because I can't see or talk to you 
It's not a single bit scary 
You're crazy crazy 
Right 
I don't like it 
Honey I came 
I'll play what I practiced today 
I don't know if you'll like it 
It's been a month right 
That guy 
It's almost time for my concert 
I need you 
Come back 
I made it happen 
Its's not Louis Bang it's Louis Jang 
His fingers move very well 
I saw it in person 
I've already said it's not Bang 
I love you 
You want me to quit being the radar 
Why do you think I'm going to get rid of you 
Yes I did 
So how much do you think you are worth 
Then did you check your account 
Customer your deposit balance is 
Mr CEO 
Your worth can still be calculated 
Thank you 
If I keep this up 
I didn't get hurt when you told me to go away 
But if you told me to go away this time 
That's right 
But 
Get lost 
Thank you 
Secretary Kim I hit the jackpot today 
Did you know 
The CEO won a bigger fish thanks to you 
This is all because of you 
I'll help you Oh thank you 
Hello 
I think you have it wrong 
Tae Gong Shil is the big sun 
Are you siding with her 
I'll go and eat 
You remember right 
Okay I'll meet her 
Then will you be assured 
Yes 
Apparently there will be strong rain here too 
Ah hot 
Kang Woo are you having a hard time 
The dead cat was really a white cat 
I couldn't sleep at all thinking about it 
I'm sorry 
Um kinda 
But there aren't only scary ones 
That's enough 
I've got it 
Please don't talk about it anymore 
I live in a different world 
Just pretend you don't know 
Because the CEO is very special to me 
I have nothing to do with the criminal 
I'll watch over you 
I'll try to stay strong 
What should I do 
Why are you like this again 
It's a person 
I'm not a person 
I'm a goddess 
Hey Salary Man 
Your face doesn't look so good 
Goddess is also a type of ghost 
I really don't like those 
Go 
I don't have to 
I already found out about everything 
It's over already 
But it was so fun 
Who's dating who 
I already said I didn't want to 
Really 
No 
Be happy 
Man it's so hard to seduce Salary Man 
Did you hear something 
It sounded like it came from a piano 
Let's go and check 
Go check that way 
I'll go check in there 
Okay 
I'm going crazy 
What is that 
Who's there 
My hand my hand my hand 
Chief 
My hand 
Isn't he the pianist 
My hand 
And my hand became like this 
I'm very sorry about that 
This hand has to play a delicate piece 
But it doesn't move 
I'm not performing 
I'm going crazy seriously 
No matter how I see it it's a bunk out 
I think our Chief stepped on poop 
How did Chief Kang get caught in this situation 
That night the vibe was weird 
He was like completely shrunk 
Can I talk to you for a minute 
I don't have anything to say 
I can see you 
You're Louie Jang's wife right 
It's the sun 
What is 
This 
An amulet 
Ah Tae Yang told me 
CanI holdon to thiswhilehe's onhistrip 
The sun was the king in the ancient times 
It used to represent death as well 
Let's go 
Why did I buy this 
This is something that I can't calculate 
Why are you here 
Didn't Secretary Kim tell you 
What 
Secretary Kim couldn't have seen this 
I bought this on my own 
But you do have it right 
Excuse me 
It's not for you 
I'm not giving it to you 
What are you talking about 
An amulet 
Then why are you here 
To solve Louis Jang's problem 
I met his wife 
She came here with me now 
Why did you come here with her 
I had to make something together 
I thought you knew cause you opened the door 
That's it 
But how much did you pay for that amulet 
Okay 
Do I put this in 
I got so startled thinking she came for this 
I let her into this kitchen 
Are you done cracking the walnuts 
I'm cracking 
Walnut you're having a very luxurious time 
Do you know how expensive this is 
I heard Louie Jang is a very sensitive person 
So doing all of this is for Kang Candy 
You still want to help him 
I accepted his apology and 
That's why I cracked the walnuts 
Is the thickness of the crust okay 
Oh more thinner 
Why is she so picky 
Why did you touch me 
I was talking to her and now she's gone 
Are you irritated with me right now 
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry 
I heard that that's kind of dangerous 
Are you listening to my heart 
From now on don't ever drink alcohol 
Are you looking 
At my tears 
Yes 
Oh you're back 
What do I 
Yes Only one 
Please be careful 
Honey and cinnamon 
Okay 
Kang Woo 
Salary man 
I heard you caused trouble 
Are you worried you might get fired 
Leave me alone Goddess 
Just get fired 
You only say and care about you're own feelings 
I really can't figure you out 
I was saying that to comfort you 
Do you feel offended 
I would try to not like them 
If that doesn't work 
You should keep jumping in 
You just like them more 
That's true 
I just have to like them more 
I try to visualize you 
It's easy 
That's a relief 
What I mean to you 
If I follow you I'm crazy 
I'm not that much 
I'm not 
I am not 
I'm always here 
If I call him he'd come right 
Because the CEO is a special person to me 
It'll be okay 
Life is like a problem that hasn't been solved 
Like how you and I met 
It was about big sun 
Shit 
I told him to like her more 
I 
What do you have to show me at this time 
How do you know that 
That's a rule that only my wife and I know 
Your wife told me 
Then are you saying that my wife 
She was watching me 
You 
You can see my wife 
Let me see her 
At the least let me speak to her 
Once just once let me see my wife 
She died so suddenly so unexpectedly 
I wasn't able to be with her at the end 
I'm sorry 
It's good to hear that you're not hurt 
But why did you come here to tell me that 
Didn't your wife pass away 
My wife was here all along staying by my side 
Now I am certain of that 
I think that's how Louis Jang feels 
That man he's clinging onto you 
What was I supposed to do when he looked so sad 
What about me 
Tomorrow 
Aren't you nervous 
When they used to crowd around me I was scared 
But since I've had some peace 
It's kind of okay seeing them 
Is that so 
Ballpoint pen 
Give it back 
I didn't think Secretary Kim was going to tell 
Oh it isn't here 
I guess I have lost it 
Deduct it from my salary 
Oh teacher I was waiting for you 
What are you doing 
I'm busy preparing for the performance 
What 
Please tell me what she says 
That's right 
I saw you guys coming here together 
When you say using her 
That's right 
And that's why you've kept her by your side 
Isn't that right 
Right 
Then I'll be going 
10 billion won radar 
Doesn't feel too good 
But's he's right 
Yes 
She wants you to dress up like this 
It's just my wife's taste 
You know I'm not your wife 
You're right 
I'll go change 
Your husband is very picky 
Gong Shil I brought the cinnamon tea 
The cinnamon aroma is 
This is good enough right 
He likes it very strong 
Wha what is this 
Is someone here again 
I'm assisting him in place of her 
I have to give it to him in that glass 
Hey what do you think you're doing 
Hey hey hey What are you saying really 
Hold this for a second 
Huh 
Right The business trip 
Huh 
Hold on 
Hey 
Master 
It's time to leave 
Alright 
Just a moment 
Mister who's there 
Are you close to Tae Gong Shil 
I will throw this out here 
Tell that friend to pick it up or not 
Why don't we rest here for a bit 
Why is it doing that 
Let's just go 
He left already 
You in this dress 
I will be able to see in a bit 
Where did you go 
Have a tea 
Me 
Having a tea 
You should be able to do in place of her 
The cinnamon aroma is very strong 
Even though I feel alone and sad I don't cry 
CEO 
This woman is ready 
When will you come dear 
We're checked in 
Let's go in 
Check his fingers one more time at the concert 
I saw them moving well 
We came here to see how your condition is 
I'm in perfect condition now 
Because this person is here 
Who is this person 
Bang Shil 
Ba 
Bang Shil 
Bang Shil 
We're heading to France right after 
You need to see me in rehearsal 
Let's go 
Since when 
What in the world is she 
Isn't that Miss Tae Gong Shil 
She does 
What's the matter 
Did you break up with Tae Gong Shil 
Tae Gong Shil is with Louie Jang right now 
Is that right 
Do you know too 
Is Tae Gong Shill really 
Louie Jang's muse 
What 
She looked like a different person 
Where is she going 
She's going with Louie Jang 
They say they're going right after the concert 
I'm so happy you came back 
Someone may recognize you and stop us 
Louie 
See you can do it alone without me 
Well it's because the situation is urgent now 
That's right 
People can change when the circumstances change 
I'm not here any more 
So you should change as well 
But you're here 
I only borrowed her temporarily 
I always lived stuck to you like a shadow 
If I saw you living normally without me 
I would have felt upset 
Because I made you stuffy 
Is that why you left me 
Is that it 
Me whose heart stopped beating 
Please let it go 
Now do all that by yourself 
Fix it 
Honey 
Honey 
Master went to China though 
Tae Gong Shil 
You're here Mr Joo Joong Won 
Are you here to save Tae Yang 
I'm here so it's time for you to leave 
Aren't you curious 
What she thinks of you 
This is good 
Are you asking if I like that person 
Is it that obvious 
But he already has someone he likes a lot 
So my feelings are a secret A secret 
I can tell you the secret I know 
I don't want to know 
Why 
Take a good look at it and get lost 
♫ When my fingertips brush you ♫ 
♫ I can't even touch you ♫ 
♫ I can't even hug you ♫ 
♫ Yes I love you as I was destined to ♫ 
Tae Gong Shil 
Are you okay 
Kang Woo I think I fell asleep here 
Wasn't CEO Joo Joong Won here 
He was 
He went on a business trip though 
Omo What is this 
Why am I wearing this 
You don't remember being with Louie Jang 
Something must have gone wrong 
What did I do 
Are you sure you are okay 
Let me take you home 
Is Tae Yang alright 
I am not alright 
You knew 
Why did you do that 
It was good to see you change 
As long as she's beside me 
I will continue to change won't I 
I don't want to change 
After 1 week 
He should be back today 
What brings you to talk to me out of the blue 
Yes 
Something's there 
What is this 
Mr CEO did Really 
This is the sun 
So pretty 
Miss Tae Gong Shil 
Have you heard 
What 
You don't know yet 
Well it just happened so fast 
What did 
Master arrived from China just now 
Really 
Hear what I have to say before you go 
She'll be in shock if she just goes like that 
Deep trouble 
Secretary Kim 
Is the CEO here 
Ah yes He's coming in 
Did you have a good time 
Well but 
Secretary Kim 
Yes 
Did you tell this lady too 
Not yet 
Ah here he comes 
♫ Wherever you are and whatever you're doing♫ 
Thoughts of you have changedmy days and nights 
Preview my heart hurts 
I really hate a mean jerk like you 
Are you saying Cha Hee Joo is alive 
I think she's still somewhere close 
Who are you 
Did you call on me 
I'll depend on you 
Wait Get lost 
I shouldn't be a Candy 
You're being ignored 
I can't do without CEO though 
Aren't you ill 
I like him though 
Don't go next to him 
I think he'll let me be next to him 
Why didn't you come to me 
I think I'm going to go 
Oh there they are 
Nice to see you Miss Seo Yeon 
Nice to see you 
Nice to see you too 
Let's head on upstairs 
Is that woman an employee here 
She keeps looking at us 
Stop looking at her and go quickly 
I can't stand it 
You go ahead 
Have you been doing well for the past week 
You don't look too bad 
For me it was hell 
Mr CEO are you really getting married 
Aren't you curious 
Don't you want to know how she feels about you 
What secret 
I can see right through her 
Can you see something 
CEO are you trying to avoid me 
No 
Then you don't have the right to ask me why 
Yes 
Episode 10 
Your aunt already went upstairs 
Let's go 
Tae Gong Shil 
Kang Woo 
Yes 
The night of Louis Jang's concert 
Did he come that night 
That night I was almost out of my mind 
I really wasn't myself 
What did they talk about 
What secret 
I can see right through her 
She must have told him my secret 
Secret 
I think she told him that I like Mr CEO 
Oh no 
It's okay 
What are you going to do 
I don't want to do that 
Secretary Kim The reason why I still don't 
The reason why I can't read 
I think he's trying to get rid of me 
But I can't live without him 
Does it have to be him 
He's my one and only hideout in this world 
Right You said you liked him 
Being ignored like this doesn't it hurt 
I can't be Candy 
I think I should go see him 
Mr CEO congratulations on your engagement 
What 
You're being scary Why are you saying this 
But instead of getting rid of it 
Can I do that Sweethome 
If not please give birth to a son 
and if you let me take care of him 
Telling me to give birth to a son 
Did that wife tell you my secret 
You're thankful right 
Is that what you did 
But it really wasn't anything 
Never mind This may actually make it easier 
You're good 
It's someone else 
You know who it is 
I like very sweet things 
Fine I'm grateful that I'm not your type 
Then I'll leave before you tell me to get lost 
Those words they made me feel terrible 
Wait 
Get lost 
Tae Gong Shil the VP's wife is looking for you 
Open it and take it out 
This one 
It's a vase 
Ahh 
Do you know how expensive this is 
I'm sorry I was surprised 
I guess you'd be surprised 
What if you'd broken it 
Even the thought is scary isn't it 
Yes 
What 
Tae Gong Sil 
It's a very valuable white porcelain 
It will turn rude and arrogant 
What 
Are you saying that to me 
Well 
I'm just speaking about the vase 
That's right 
I'm saying this nicely to you but what 
Rude and arrogant 
I'm sorry 
I was just talking about this vase 
This was originally just a water container 
You're really dangerous 
That really should be destroyed 
Someone will get bewitched 
Bang Shil fighting 
Scary things will come around 
Bewitched 
Bang Shil's talking about herself isn't she 
It was a little scary 
No 
I saw a ghost 
Is that so 
The marriage has been announced now 
You'll get rid of her right 
You're going to let her stay by your side 
Is she refusing to leave 
I'm not letting her go 
I'm going to keep seeing her 
Until when 
Until I don't want to see her anymore 
Was she scared because of this 
Is something attached to it 
Joong Won Do you know how much this is 
He really 
CEO Joo fighting 
Big Tae Yang is dating the CEO of Kingdom 
As if 
Really 
He's just playing her a bit 
Why 
What's wrong with big Tae Yang 
You have to see her to come to your senses 
Do you want to meet her Let's pick a date 
You're going to be surprised 
Are you alright 
What did you see in the porcelain 
Isn't it that something scary followed you 
It didn't follow me 
They didn't seem to understand me 
Why didn't you come to me 
Can I be honest 
If you can go ahead 
Misunderstanding 
I won't do that type of thing 
Yes 
Alright then 
In the movie the goat also likes the wolf 
Then what happens 
The goat likes the wolf so much that it says 
Wolf just eat me 
That goat must be crazy 
♫ I can't even touch you ♫ 
Don't you want to know her secret 
I don't want to know 
Why 
Yes 
Ah I don't know 
Don't know 
To tell you the truth this wedding is fake 
It's business for both sides 
I didn't come here for a study but on an exile 
The excuse of marriage will a week be enough 
I will give you the wings so that you can fly 
That proposal 
I will accept it 
Does Tae Gong Shil know the truth 
She doesn't 
I understand 
It's just like a dignified scholar 
Just look at it 
That's a ridiculous story 
Honey what do you think you are doing 
I mean what about it 
No one's around anyway 
What about me 
I told you that I hate undignified people 
Go scratch in the bathroom 
I get it 
How did I fall for a man like that 
When he wasn't even my type 
I liked men who were like dignified scholars 
Who are you 
Before 
Not being decent 
Go sleep in another room 
I was meeting a noble scholar  in my dream 
Why that kick 
Who did you meet 
I'm going to the VP's office now 
Let's go together 
Is there a ghost 
I saw something there 
That's why I wanted to go to check on it 
Let's go together 
I'll bring the keys 
Let's go 
Are you going to stay here 
Yes 
No 
I guess Kang Woo will probably take her 
He's saying it so I could hear him but 
I didn't hear anything 
What is this 
Did she already leave 
Kang Woo 
You can hold me if you're scared 
Ok then 
I'll lean on you 
I don't want to hold on like a kid 
I am used to this posture 
Ok 
But please loosen your grip 
Alright 
I will 
Where should we look 
The vase isn't here 
No ghosts either 
They aren't there 
Tae Gong Shil you aren't scared 
I'm scared too 
I'm just more used to it than you 
But he's getting married now 
I don't think I can keep staying by his side 
don't go back to him 
It will hurt 
Wait for me and we'll go together 
There's something there though 
Then you direct me to a place without them 
But it also has no taste 
Hold it 
Is Kang Woo not here 
The Chief is out somewhere 
We see you a lot 
No you're a goddess of course 
Appearing in our security office a goddess 
What is that 
It's the Chief's 
It's cute 
I'm sorry but a picture 
What is this 
Kang Woo 
You're so cute 
Did you just do this because you were scared 
Do it again 
That's enough 
Why are you here again 
There might be an article about you and me 
We got our photos taken in the subway 
I'm meeting with a close reporter tomorrow 
That article will become number one 
Kang Woo 
It got on well 
Let's go 
Let's show Gong Shil too 
This color and this color are the same 
Is that right 
Yes I understand 
I'll go first then 
Mr CEO didn't leave yet 
He's not here 
OH MY GOD 
I thought you were a ghost 
It would be better if I was a ghost 
I'm really popular among the ghosts 
When they see me 
I actually seem like the sun 
I'm not even a ghost but why am I like this 
What 
Come in 
Sit 
Tae Gong Shil do you just want to be Candy 
Come out of hostage I'll get you a house 
You might need a car choose one 
Do you want to study more Then do it 
I'll let you 
Is there a big ghost that you need to find 
And I'm thinking about studying but 
The relationship that you and I have 
I want to set things straight 
Do it the easy way 
Just be simple and be Candy 
Then I for sure can get rid of you 
If you're curious about the end I'm not scared 
I don't want to do it 
Then what do you want me to do 
I don't expect anything like that 
Why is it so hard for you 
Is it a burden that I might like you 
I don't like you 
I'll just go catch the porcelain ghost 
There are none here Go home 
Let's go 
Look at this 
After hearing all that you don't say 
Let's go 
Where did you see her 
I guess I have to keep holding you hand 
There was 
Pen 
Oh as an amulet 
Mr CEO I've been thinking 
I think I can leave first 
So don't worry too much 
There will be an end 
Necklace 
I don't think she picked it up 
Am I really that burdensome 
I'll give you three minutes of time 
Secretary Kim 
Make all of it into mirrors 
Make it pretty 
Everyone got it 
A Suite room 
They even borrowed the whole swimming pool 
Who 
Over there 
But I heard she got dumped 
Because he's marrying someone else 
Of course I knew it would happen 
I knew it was going to be like this 
But I'm still kind of jealous 
What are you jealous of 
Are they talking about me 
Even I would marry someone else 
This is good 
Try it 
How vulgar and repulsive 
Why are you being like this again 
Why you keep hating everything I do 
A man be such a flake 
I lost my appetite Her name is also Gong Shil 
Thank you 
Really 
Please take care of Gong Shil 
Okay I'll reserve the restaurant 
I'll see you later 
Is this your office 
It's so tiny 
I'll go 
I think I need to go to places like that 
Really 
I'm asking this because I'm really curious 
What's your relationship with CEO Joo Joong Won 
Just look at it as you see it 
I heard that you got rejected 
If it looked like that I guess it is 
That's too bad 
I know right 
What's that 
Gong Shil her name is Gong Shil too 
Is this Dooly's copycat 
Yes I will go to the airport on time 
Okay I'll see you then 
Are you going to find this woman 
If she's alive I need to find her 
Joo Woong 
To the CEO Cha Hee Joo isn't a curse but a pain 
Maybe it is a real curse 
He kicks everyone out not letting anyone near 
That's right 
And he always goes get lost 
Are you talking about CEO and me 
I'm on your side 
Where's the location 
Are you not planning to continue 
I'm not going to tell you 
Honey 
Why is this person doing this to me lately 
We have to break that though 
Is aunt really wierd 
Tae Gong Sil said to break this 
Yes she did 
But still 
President Joo you take responsibility for this 
You said to break this Do I really have to 
Is your aunt not feeling well 
She's in a really bad state 
She's in a critical state and can't even get up 
Then do I break this or not 
Then you're supposed to break it 
Do I break it or not 
You can't really break those things though 
She's the only aunt I have though 
Then you have to break it 
Then it's decided 
We're trusting your words and breaking this 
Why do I have to take responsibility for that 
Because of you she's dying so we break it 
No 
Honey Honey 
What 
What 
What's wrong 
Are you okay 
Are you okay 
What was that 
What was that 
I don't see anything 
For you it wasn't like that right 
What do I do 
Is there something there 
It was Gong Sil to Gong Sil talking 
It's been almost a week How do you feel 
You said that you had a gathering today right 
Sumo said that you were very nervous 
That's right 
I guess so 
Who 
That won't do then 
Yes 
Then do you have an appointment 
Oh with Tae Yang 
Yes 
Who makes those rumors anyway 
Really 
Eat this 
Lee Hyun Joo is right here 
Why would the vice president look for you 
I wonder too 
I wonder why 
Then go and found out who has the cheap mouth 
Then I'll be going This is takeout 
Honey 
What again 
I fell for those sexy lips 
You must have gone crazy 
I wonder 
Honey 
It's been a year already 
Maybe there's some other issue 
Kang Woo it's been a long time 
Let's go 
Thanks to you the problem's been solved 
It's unfortunate that we must stop here 
It's nothing to be unfortunate about 
We should both calculate how big that is 
Yes it's been a long time I come by a lot 
Oh big Tae Yang 
Wow it's been a really long time 
Hi 
Come here 
Are you okay 
What's wrong 
No No it's nothing I'm okay 
It's famous 
I hope you get free from your curse next time 
That girl said that she was the fourth curse 
Even though we gather them it won't be fun 
They all are pushed out by a dead girl 
A heart that no one accepts is cursed 
Who do you think this other woman is 
That's Cha Hee Joo Where is this place 
England 
One year after Cha Hee Joo died 
Then are you saying Cha Hee Joo is alive 
I found the living Cha Hee Joo in Europe 
That's the most possible scenario 
But I found something very strange 
What are these 
Did this woman follow around CEO Joo Joong Won 
Yes 
Who is she 
I haven't seen her around 
She moved here not too long ago 
It's Tae Gong Shil 
I heard your father just checked in the hotel 
Chief Kang Woo will be here soon 
Will you see him and listen to what he says 
I guess he's going to join them 
Wow 
Her boyfriend is so tall and good looking 
Yes I've gotten much better 
Until what age can you go back to your study 
There's still time but 
Gong Shil Tell me about you 
You said you're working at Kingdom right 
You 
The CEO there is he really your boyfriend 
Tell them in detail what you told me 
How 
The safety hideout came Hide 
How do you see me after hearing my story 
Hey we're so jealous 
I envy you 
And then what 
You know the ending is what's important 
No wonder 
Because I can never be separated from him 
That's a little 
That's me 
So you take the responsibility 
Let's go 
What are you doing here 
Please have a fun and enjoyable time here 
My baby Will you come with Oppa 
Let's go 
What the heck do they think they're doing 
Stop it 
I get it now This is me in your world 
Tae Gong Shil 
What's wrong 
What's wrong 
Did something happen 
I was taking her with me 
Kang Woo 
What's the matter 
Why is Tae Gong Shil acting that way 
Why did CEO Joo come here 
What about you Why are you here 
Did you come here because of her too 
Yes 
Do you really like Tae Gong Shil 
Yes 
I told you I would I'm like that even now 
Can I trust that 
From now on you handle everything 
Thank you 
I can handle everything 
Is that right 
Then start with handling this 
Tae Yang I think I love you 
What will you do now 
Tae Gong Shil 
I love you 
Episode 13 
I knew that I sensed something bad about you 
I told you to stay away from him didn't I 
Honey 
Madame Joo 
How's my Joong Won doing 
Then he's not dead 
President Joo is still alive 
We were able to safely complete the surgery 
So he didn't die after all 
I need to see him 
He thinks that he's dead 
What do you mean he's dead 
How dare you say he's dead 
Ms Tae 
How's President Joo 
He was able to complete his surgery safely 
Is he awake 
His aunt isn't by his bedside right now 
Thank you 
I must've been completely entranced by you 
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry 
How's President Joo 
Is Tae Gong Shil still here 
I saw President Joo 
What if he doesn't come back 
I can see ghosts but I can't call them out 
I have to go see that lady 
He's probably preparing himself to disappear 
Joong Won 
Are you able to read now 
It's because I'm dead 
So you can finally see me now 
We can now finally be together 
You have to summon his spirit 
Please summon him quickly 
I need your skills 
Can you offer yourself to me as a sacrifice 
Why 
Do you need to think about it 
There's not much time 
Just please help me get him back 
The deal has been made 
Okay I will now summon forth your man's spirit 
In order to summon him I need a special item 
An item that he'd be able to recognize 
Is that proof that you're his sun 
I think that would work just fine 
I love you 
I said all the moments 
The sun All the memories of you being with him 
That's what it truly means 
Will you be okay with that 
It doesn't matter 
Well then 
In that case 
Joo Joong Won Let's see if we can find him 
You are not dead You have to go back 
Don't forget the deal that you and I made 
He's probably back safely in his body 
Joo Joong Won 
Wake up 
Wake up 
President Joo 
Please please open your eyes 
Are you awake 
You're awake Mr Joo Joong Won 
She'll be so happy to see that you're awake 
The patient is awake 
Joong Won is awake 
That's such a relief 
This cannot go any further 
It's such a relief that he's awake 
No it's okay This is the end 
I won't go any further than this 
No he won't 
I'm not going to appear in his life anymore 
What happened to me 
What do you mean what happened 
I told you to get rid of her 
You almost died this time following her there 
Follow who 
Who are you talking about 
Chief Secretary Kim 
Master Joo you're awake It's such a relief 
Why am I in here 
Did I really get struck by lightning 
I remember going there with Chief Secretary Kim 
Then let me get struck down by lightning 
That's the last thing that I remember 
Joong Won do you really not remember anything 
But how did I end up like this 
It's because you and Tae Gong 
But who's that woman over there 
Chief Secretary Kim Yes Honey 
Yes 
Let's go 
How's your breathing 
It hurts It hurts quite a bit 
We will do a more thorough examination tomorrow 
You made a promise 
I'll understand and disappear at once 
This must be that moment 
Yes I understand 
Chief Secretary Kim 
Yes 
Please I beg of you I understand 
And President Joo saved Gong Shil's life 
You don't need to know 
Here eat this 
You should've stayed at the hospital longer 
Why did you insist on coming home so soon 
Will be you alright alone 
Why don't you come stay at my place 
Can you bring it to me I'm starving right now 
Really 
I'll go get it right now 
Then get some rest 
What 
Do you have something to say to me 
What happened to me 
Make it simple and tell me what happened 
Something important is missing here 
And you know what that is don't you 
So just spill it out while my aunt isn't here 
My lips aren't twitching 
What is this here 
I don't know Why do you keep asking me 
It's a children's book 
Why are these books doing in my house 
No kidding 
You can't even read 
What's going on with me 
How would I know 
I really don't know anything 
Why am I able to read right now 
President Joo 
Did I really get struck down by lightning 
Just what in the world happened to me 
It's a protective seal 
Yeah this is all I need 
This is enough for me 
What the heck 
Joong Won 
Why did you come in to work 
You should be at home resting 
I can read now 
I can easily read every single word 
But who's responsible for that PR sign 
It's so tacky I'm going to have to change that 
That's the vice president's style 
I'm going to change it 
Gong Shil He's finally able to read now 
The trash can man told me about it 
Isn't it great 
That's a relief 
Okay you're coming with me 
I had a feeling that you would be able to 
You've been making a lot of effort to change 
I did 
Yes 
What's that 
I really can't wrap my head around this 
Golfing 
That's just absurd 
What personal matter 
To me 
Why 
It's not just because of that 
An army runaway 
Yes you did that 
I'm sure that wasn't me Something's wrong here 
That joke wasn't funny was it 
Wait 
But a child abuse center 
I'm not sure 
President Joo seriously doesn't remember you 
No he doesn't 
Amazing isn't it 
Are you sure you don't need to talk to him 
Yes it was an accident 
I was torn between my world and the reality 
You know that's not what this is 
I know that you really truly liked him 
It's sealed in here 
So I will be okay 
Look at that 
This was just a storage room 
Who are you 
When did this turn into an office 
It's the Special Guest Center 
It's an office that you had set up yourself 
Special Guest Center 
I created something so useless as that 
What about you 
Kang Woo 
You're the new Security Team Leader right 
Yes 
And this is 
She's the employee in charge of this office 
I see 
Did I leave something there 
Ahh my back 
Just leave your stuff here 
I'll bring them home to you later 
Actually why don't I just come with you 
It's okay 
There's not that much for me to take anyways 
What kind of a weak seal is that 
No kidding 
I have my Gong Shil 
Yes 
So why was he trying to find her twin sister 
There's something that you're not aware of 
What do you mean by that 
Are you alright 
You seem really shocked by this news 
Then 
We must find that girl in the picture 
No that can't be 
Han Na was such a bright and kind child 
Thank you Uncle 
Your new parents are happy about it 
Yes of course 
I'm going to Korea soon 
Korea 
Uncle 
Didn't you tell me that I'm a twin 
I want to go and find my sister 
But I haven't been able to find her 
I'm going to find her 
Okay 
My sister is dead 
I hate you 
The dead girl's name was Cha Hee Joo 
Cha Hee Joo 
Remember the name Cha Hee Joo 
I need to find Han Na 
I'll be careful 
I'm going to protect you from now on 
Not holding on is my way of protecting him 
What are you doing here 
I'm not here to see you 
I came to see Tae Gong Shil 
I heard she no longer works for Kingdom 
What do you need to talk to her about 
I just came to see if that's really true 
So all that was true 
OH MY GOD 
Let go 
Why do you hate Tae Gong Shil so much 
Don't you dare continue to like her 
If you continue to like her 
You really are a freak 
What 
Black whiskered whales don't exist 
I looked it up 
Really 
I wonder if it was just something in the water 
Why 
Because you want to keep me in your pond 
You don't need to take care of me 
Just open yourself up to me 
You don't have to feed me nor take care of me 
Why 
Do you find what I'm doing pathetic 
No 
It's cool 
It's cool 
Being confident without begging 
It's very cool 
Really 
Yeah Seeing you has given me strength 
But I think I need to become as cool as you 
What the heck 
Yeah 
Thanks You just taught me something 
Hey 
I'm Dooley 
Something that doesn't exist on this earth 
Dooley 
Kang Woo 
Gong Shil 
What should I do 
This is Han Na whom you met at the hospital 
She helped me out a lot that day 
Aunt 
Try to remember 
A special person 
Was there a special person in my life 
Those are my books 
I forgot and left them here 
Oh That's right you did 
Han Na brought those books here 
That makes me feel pretty good to hear that 
You two must be fated to be together 
So he can read those books now 
I'm happy for him 
Tae Yi Ryung 
Tae Yi Ryung 
Hi Yi Ryung 
Yeah Meet me there okay 
Wait right there I'll be there soon 
Tae Yi Ryung Tae Tae 
There's a 'Tae' something 
Are you okay 
I was standing behind you because of that book 
A real strong shock 
No I didn't 
Did she think that I was coming onto her 
I know I felt something when I touched her 
What could it be 
Master Joo 
A personal matter of mine came up 
I would like to take a few days off 
Okay Enjoy your time off 
Where will you be going 
I'm going to England 
Master Joo 
Yes I know 
Enjoy a relaxing time off 
Keep your head up Gong Shil 
That's right 
Anyways you have amazing qualifications 
No kidding 
I don't remember telling you about all that 
Yes destroy 
How about you give me a copy of your resume 
I'm going to take a quick look okay 
Thank you for your concern though 
I'll see you later Bye 
To be honest ever since the accident 
This is a big problem 
I'm sorry please excuse me 
That's a very pretty necklace 
Tae Gong Shil 
The Sun 
Is it in the shape of a sun 
Yes Thank you 
Cha Hee Joo 
I'm positive that it was Cha Hee Joo 
That woman 
Do you remember Han Na whom you recently met 
I'm still hurting there 
Oops sorry 
Didn't you tell me that she's from England 
Ms Han Na is here 
Come on in 
Ms Han Na 
What is it 
No it's nothing Please have a seat 
Yes I'm positive that I saw her 
Do you know what's going on with that at all 
Tae Gong Shil 
It's because I can see Hee Joo 
We have a lead on who Hee Joo's co conspirator 
Really 
Even if you continue to see Hee Joo around 
I guess you're right 
It's been fifteen years 
I came because there's someone that I must find 
Do you remember my niece 
Han Na 
Han Na Brown 
My father is English and my mother is Korean 
The truth is 
I was adopted 
I discovered my uncle when I was still a child 
I see 
But I was never able to find her twin sister 
Han Na and Hee Joo 
It's these two kids 
These are my business cards 
Are you the kids from that organization 
Special person 
I'm someone's special person 
You said she's your sun 
Tae Gong Shil at your apartment 
Who's there 
Cha Hee Joo

Team Leader Kang 
They live at the same place 
I heard that she comes from England 
Shall we 
How do you feel about him 
I'm interested in him as well 
Hee Joo I assume 
Did Tae Gong Shil know the late Hee Joo 
There's no way that she could 
Yes I see 
Calling forth a dead person's ghost 
That really is all nonsense 
Shall we go 
Can't I just relay the message to him for you 
Then will you be able to catch the culprit 
'One stormy night' 
Who are you 
Are you my sun 
Episode 14 
Are you my sun 
I don't know who you are 
Who are you to me 
I'm just a penniless woman 
So what could I possibly be to you 
How and in what way am I special to you 
I hitched a ride in your car one night 
That's how you became a special person to me 
There's no way I would've done that 
By any chance is this building yours 
I said that 
I find your jokes to be very offensive 
But I did 
I'll just keep it for myself 
Thanks for everything 
Goodbye 
Is that really everything 
Don't touch me I told you that it's over 
You came after me so I kept you around 
But I know that this isn't everything 
I feel flustered but I don't dislike it 
Is what I've lost in your possession 
You did leave something here 
Wait out here I'll go and give it back to you 
I'll leave my beer here 
See Now there's plenty of room 
Take it with you 
Thanks 
For going away so easily 
and for returning what's mine back to me 
Don't ever come here again 
Tae Gong Shil 
She said her name is Tae Gong Shil 
You know her don't you 
Do you remembered who she is 
But you were pretty far gone 
Continue 
A sense of desire unlike that of anyone else 
That's what I fell for 
You're lying aren't you 
No I'm serious 
What else 
I'm not going to let her go 
You're arrogant and rude 
So I'm going to do whatever I can to break it 
You need to be very careful 
So are you going to start over again with her 
Your belly 
I've heard enough you may go now 
Okay 
that it's gone 
Are you sure that you'll be alright without him 
It is a little disappointing 
I'm worried about you 
I can handle it 
When I got stabbed on my back 
Something feels empty 
Don't ever go back there to retrieve it 
Don't worry about me 
Seriously 
Yes 
I was always at the top of my class 
Are you bragging right now 
Yes 
When you do I'll become your bodyguard 
Ah that's right 
If I'm to ask you to be my bodyguard 
Let's cheers to that 
Let's both become amazing people 
Hey You have your coffee right here 
Why are you asking me for my soda 
No not at all 
I've gotten much braver now 
Cheers to you too 
Cheers 
If you truly care about Joong Won 
then lend me your body 
But she hasn't come back to ask me again 
Yes 
I really appreciate the help you gave me 
And what of his memories 
His memories are sealed in there 
But I see that you haven't return it to him 
That would make you meaningless to him 
Well that's up to you to decide 
You haven't forgotten our deal have you 
What is it that I need to do 
First 
I'm a marriage matchmaker for the dead 
Excuse me 
By any chance are you single 
I'm sorry 
Miss 
Want to come with me 
I don't want to go to America to shoot a movie 
Do you know what a great opportunity this is 
It's with the famed movie director Peter Jason 
I can't act 
Can't that director tell just by looking at me 
Let's tell him that you'll take the role 
Are you trying to get me away from Kingdom 
Nice try 
Let's just go there for a year 
I'll think about it 
That's Tae Gong Shil 
Yes 
Do you think that she'd help my Seung Won 
feel less lonely in his afterlife 
Yes 
Kang Woo 
I may have to move to America to film a movie 
Really 
But I have the body and the looks 
You saw my movie 
I thought you said you never saw it 
It was showing on TV Ah 
That movie was a melodrama 
I hate crying 
I agree Crying really doesn't suit you 
Seeing you cry put me in a really bad mood 
You're already cool so I'm sure you'll do well 
That really would be an honor But 
I must turn down your offer Ms Tae Yi Ryung 
Dog like manners 
A lady clad in black 
Yeah 
I'm not lying Go ask Tae Gong Shil yourself 
Ask her why was she with that lady in black 
I wonder if it's the same woman 
Yes I have somewhere that I need to go 
How are your studies coming along 
Have you been seeing her since then 
Yes she's asked me to help her with something 
I'd better get going 
Forever 
My Kingdom 
What you saw before won't happen again 
I think this point 
To be more precise 
Contract on the subsidiary branch in Shanghai 
The price has been negotiated 
Kingdom 
Do Re Mi Mi 
This must make you very happy 
This is where she supposedly worked 
But I still don't remember anything 
It's completely empty 
I'm getting married next week 
Since this man is still living can you just 
This man says he's getting married next week 
My nephew should be here soon 
Will you be okay with him dining with us 
Have you told him that I'm here with you 
Didn't I already tell you how much I like you 
Isn't that Tae Gong Shil 
Is she a friend of yours 
No not at all 
A spirit matchmaker 
Hold on a moment 
Yes you're right 
Wow 
Yes she is here right now 
Are you sure that I'm being haunted by a ghost 
She says she's very sad and lonely 
Is my candy girl sad and lonely too 
I'm working right now 
Don't put your hands on me 
Have you ever met with this lady yourself 
Will I really 
be able to get rid of her 
I don't know if I should be telling you this 
But I almost died 
Get lost 
Don't pay attention to anything he just said 
It bothers me and it upsets me 
I invited her to dine with us 
You're okay with that right 
I don't have any memories of you 
but have we met somewhere before 
This is Han Na 
This isn't the way I remember how Han Na looked 
Han Na had plastic surgery 
Plastic surgery 
Yes 
Han Na told me that she hated her face 
You told me that Han Na was in Korea right 
I must find her and meet with her 
No it's okay 
I think I know where she is 
It rankled you didn't it 
What kind of a favor 
I asked her to summon someone for me 
Sees what 
Ghosts It should be interesting 
But where are we going now 
I haven't been able to sleep at all lately 
This time it's for a very special person 
That's what you always say 
Here she comes now 
Joong Won 
Ms Tae Gong Shil 
You can see ghosts 
Are there any in here right now 
Yes I see her 
I always see her 
She's standing right next to President Joo 
Cha Hee Joo 
Stop showing yourself in front of me anymore 
I don't want to see you anymore 
Just tell me right now 
Who's the culprit that caused your death 
I'll relay your message to him 
That's enough 
I'm working right now 
Don't lay your hand on me 
Joong Won 
I now see 
why that man is special to her 
You can see ghosts 
Yes I see ghosts 
Candy girl was kind of cute 
but this is scary isn't it 
You even set me up in an office 
The special customer care center 
But you started paying me on a per case basis 
Is that what you're telling me 
It would've been better if you hadn't found out 
It's scary now that you know isn't it 
Things like that doesn't scare me 
Yes you're right What you said is true 
You got hurt while you were with me 
What does it matter to you 
I don't wish to see you again 
Please don't acknowledge me anymore 
Don't touch me I don't like it 
A ten billion won radar 
Hi my ten billion won radar 
Your shield is here Hide 
By any chance are you with me right now 
If you are really here with me now 
I apologize to you 
I'm sorry for what happened 
Sis 
Yes 
Cha Hee Joo had a twin sister 
Is that why she was my ten billion won radar 
Yes that's what you said in the past 
Are you starting to remember anything 
No I can't remember anything 
But I guess she still pulled her weight 
The bastard who stabbed me in the back 
he's dead if I ever get my hands on him 
But he's here looking at you right now 
Excuse me 
The shopping mall is over that way 
Okay 
Excuse me a moment 
I need to see that woman 
Ever since what that woman told me 
I've felt like I've lost my mind 
You 
Did you come here to kill Ms Tae Gong Shil 
I just need to see that woman 
I I wasn't aiming for you 
I got stabbed in her place 
Yes that's right 
I really wasn't trying to stab you on purpose 
What's going on here 
Then you're telling me that 
I was willing to die for that woman 
And that's why I jumped in 
Well the thing is 
Yes that's right 
This is driving me crazy 
This was an office for ghosts 
Just how much did I lose 
my mind over for that woman 
Didn't she say that there is something here 
Do you guys know something 
Is she really not necessary to me 
Bitter 
So bitter 
Even ghosts have their preferences 
Wandered around 
Wander around where 
How would I know that 
Was she brain dead 
Here drink this 
Stay close and keep an eye on her 
So is it completely over with that man 
Do you think that she'd recognize me 
Tae Gong Shil 
Kang Woo 
You look exhausted Are you okay 
I heard that you caught the culprit 
I got a call from the police 
Really 
That's great 
Right 
I'm so grateful 
Who knows 
Maybe I'll appear out of thin air like a ghost 
I really appreciate your sentiment 
Goodnight 
Oh my goodness Joong Won loves this wine 
I guess you're going to need a date 
I'd love to 
Excuse me for a moment 
She cried every time she came 
Died and came back to life 
I can't remember 
Okay Chief Secretary Kim are you here 
Where could he be 
Chief Secretary Kim 
What should I do 
I wonder if I should wait for him 
Are you in there 
What is this 
Did you think that I was a ghost 
Where's Chief Secretary Kim 
I can send text messages now 
Why did you call me out here 
Follow me 
Sit 
I thought about everything very carefully 
And I almost lost my life in the process 
Right 
Yes that's right 
You know don't you 
How would I know that 
You You saw me didn't you 
Yes you came to see me 
What is it that I said to you 
Yes 
You told me something truly frightening 
Something frightening 
Because I can handle that much 
Tae Gong Shil 
I love you 
So why can't I remember a damn thing 
Your memories are never going to come back 
It's been safely sealed away 
So you don't need to worry 
Yes I'm okay without it 
That's what I want 
I'll do the same I'll be leaving now 
Leave 
Damn it 
Ugh it's bitter 
Okay 
It's all over now 
I'll go get that for you 
It's the same handwriting 
How is that possible 
Chief Secretary Kim 
You're back 
Is it Han Na Brown 
How did you know 
Mr Joo Joong Won 
It doesn't matter 
That man is now a married man 
It's time for you to leave now 
Because you're dead 
She's gone now 
Is it okay if I go home now 
Instead of searching for his memories 
he's found another future by his side 
Mr Joo Joong Won 
Don't come to me anymore 
Just go away 
You came 
Hello 
Hi 
You're looking beautiful as always 
What a nice thing to say 
Why don't you join us in a drink 
I saw Tae Gong Shil out in the lobby 
She was with that woman Madame Go 
That has nothing to do with me 
Really Okay 
What else 
Your aunt told me something 
No that's not it 
I don't want to get my memories back 
Just tell me what the contract is 
How much would it take 
But 
Yes you can get them back 
Shall I tell you how 
No I don't want to know 
It's very simple 
I said I don't want to know 
We've concluded that we can live without it 
I know 
That's why it keeps bothering me 
I understand 
Your sun will continue to be miserable 
Just tell me how much that contract is worth 
That woman gave all of herself 
Joong Won 
Are you in pain 
Yes I'm in pain 
Are you okay 
It drew my attention from the beginning 
Are you in a great deal of pain 
I need to go and get back what I lost 
Mr Joo Joong Won 
It looks the same 
but it's not the real thing 
Things really are over between him and I 
Watch me 
I'm going to throw this away 
So don't come to me anymore 
Did you get your memories back 
That's right 
Do you think that I'm here because I want to 
Yes that's right 
I was happy without you too 
I was much happier without you in my world 
Don't lie to me 
There's no way you could've felt like living 
Tae Gong Shil 
leaving 
When I'm by your side 
That makes me really fear and hate myself 
Just tell me to get lost now 
Get lost my sun 
Weren't you here with Ms Tae 
Where is she 
Episode 16 
Make sure to call me often okay 
Is he the one that's going with you 
That man 
he's the one from your accident right 
That's why you shouldn't worry 
I'll be back okay 
Okay 
Bye 
Take care Gong Ri Okay 
I'll call you 
She left you 
When I thought about it 
Do I look crazy to you 
To let Tae Gong Shil leave me like this 
Please answer your phone 
Did you end things with that man 
How could I have ended it 
I just forced myself to walk away from him 
I wish the plane would just take off already 
His crappy dog manners 
Tae Gong Shil left on a flight headed for L A 
Get me a seat on the next flight out 
Joong Won is going to America 
Why is he going to America all of a sudden 
What could this be about 
I'm not sure 
No it's nothing 
I need to use the bathroom 
Tae Gong Shil 
Yi Ryung What are you doing here 
Are you going to America too 
Oh that I'm just going there for an audition 
Is he with you 
We went to school together 
Nothing sooner 
No nothing as of now 
You just let Tae Gong Shil leave 
I'm not letting her leave 
I'm going to follow her and bring her back 
This is a tracking device Take this with you 
Tae Gong Shil doesn't know that I did that 
You're a very clever man Team Leader Kang 
Come back and work for me at Kingdom again 
I'll double your salary 
Turn it on for me 
Tae Yi Ryung 
Kang Woo 
How do you know that 
She's on the same flight that I'm on 
Really 
The plane is still on the ground 
Hello 
Hello 
Hey 
Hey you dog 
President Joo Joong Won 
Ms Tae Yi Ryung listen to me very carefully 
I need your gifted acting skills right now 
Excuse me 
Hey 
Do you consider me a good actress 
What 
Yi Ryung 
What's wrong 
Gong Shil 
My stomach hurts 
What What's wrong with your stomach 
I don't know But it really hurts 
I think it's my appendicitis 
Help Someone help us 
Please We need some help 
Is she okay She needs help 
Gong Shil 
It's okay Yi Ryung 
Just hang on 
Big Sun 
Yes 
Stay with me 
Big Sun 
Gong Shil 
Don't leave me Gong Shil 
It's okay just hang on 
Gong Shil 
Gong Shil 
Big Sun 
No 
Come with me 
You go on ahead 
You're her guardian so you get in with her 
Tae Gong Shil 
Be understanding and considerate 
I'm going to have to start doing those things 
I want you to remain by my side and help me 
I'm not good at things like that 
Yes I'll do that 
But Master Joo 
I'm a little disappointed 
It wasn't easy 
You know that I'm not that easy of a person 
I'm not so sure 
Chief Secretary Kim Yes 
Okay 
Little Sun 
Can't you tell by looking 
I was faking it 
Maybe I should do that 
And President Joo Joong Won asked me to do it 
He asked me to get you off that plane 
Then why did you do it 
That's why I helped him 
But that's not at all how you looked 
Candy That's right 
Make me stay if you really love me 
Yi Ryung 
A fatal flaw 
I think I know what it is 
Okay what is it 
I see dead people 
What 
There's one in here too 
I don't believe in things like that 
He says he's a fan of yours 
I'm leaving now 
Hey Tae Gong Shil Where are you going 
It's scary 
I really hate ghost stories 
Woo Jin it's you 
But why are you still here 
It's Woo Jin's mom 
I don't want to see you 
Mr Joo Joong Won 
Who are you 
I'm the man that's leaving with Gong Shil 
I'm sure that Gong Shil must've told you 
Ms Tae 
Chief Secretary Kim 
How could you have left without a word 
I wasn't running away 
I was just going to search for something 
The reason why I ended up this way 
I'm not sure of that myself 
We can only know once we get there 
That's not what's important 
But now 
That's why I came to see Gong Shil 
What is it that you can do for Tae Gong Shil 
How so 
She won't be afraid anymore 
Yes 
Is Tae Gong Shil aware of all this 
Yes 
That's why she's coming with me 
To leave like that for the sake of someone else 
Seriously 
I'm not sure 
He's Master Joo 
Even though I had to force you to come back 
Listen President Joo Why did you hold me back 
Who do you think you're talking to 
Was I being that obvious 
Okay then I'll be blunt and tell you how it is 
I 
I'm leaving for the sake of my own survival 
I can't live like this anymore 
I need to find out why I ended up this way 
Can you find your reason and come back to me 
I can't promise you that I'll come back to you 
I told you didn't I 
The day that I got stabbed by the screwdriver 
I never should've gone after you 
Can you understand what I'm saying 
Thank you 
I'm going to leave just like I had planned 
Why 
Because you're a sexual molester 
You've touched every nook and cranny of my body 
10 000 won 
One million won 
Didn't you just tell me that you understood 
That woman doesn't have any self respect 
I don't get scared when I'm sure of the ending 
And now I got what I asked for 
I love you 
Would that have been enough 
I totally forgot that I said those words to her 
Death the end and not being attracted 
No I'm sure she didn't hear me say that 
I need to say nicer words to her 
I heard that Han Na Brown was the culprit 
Yes 
Honey What Bang Shil did was amazing 
Honey 
Joong Won Are you okay 
Okay 
I can take care of them both myself 
So both of you just leave 
Go I said 
He has me 
Who are you referring to 
I'm talking about Bang Shil 
Deputy Ahn told me a few things 
President Joo went after her and got her back 
My goodness my heart just breaks for them 
That's just unbelievable 
It wasn't like that 
You shouldn't go 
Okay He's not the reason why I'm leaving 
Hey that man 
Why are you talking to my sister like that 
Ms Tae Gong Shil 
Me Yes 
Why 
I'm his head shoulders knees and toes 
So you were just fishing for information 
Wait Tae Gong Ri 
So I'm not going to do that anymore 
No don't do that 
You once told me that I was ominous didn't you 
What you said was right 
Bang Shil 
Is that it 
If anything I'm grateful to you 
Are you trying to play me too 
No 
Everyone can't seem to understand me 
You know that I can't do that 
This kid is he following you around 
His name is Woo Jin 
Are you not going to help this kid out 
Then I'll wait for you at the airport tomorrow 
So you're the cause of Gong Shil's agony huh 
It seems as though even her final decision 
She's sleeping 
Seeing how she's sleeping so peacefully 
What the heck 
Did you attack me just now 
So I won't get mad at you 
But are you sure that was enough 
But thanks for such a bland ending 
What 
No I wouldn't have gotten mad 
Kang Woo 
That didn't count 
I'm going to do it right this time 
There are reporters waiting outside 
You can't come out there okay 
I should've just jumped on him 
I discovered a huge injustice along the process 
What's ridiculous 
When in fact we've never even really started 
Don't you find that funny 
It feels weird 
See 
I'll just go in and change real quick 
Make it quick 
This is my favorite udon restaurant 
This place is the best in this area 
Really 
I find that to be unfair too 
I'll stop by before I leave 
That's too bad 
I guess you're right 
You even have horses 
I saw the ghost of a horse once 
But you can't ride the ghost of a horse 
President Joo 
Excuse me 
Tae Gong Shil 
Don't go 
Hey Blabbermouth 
This is my bottle 
Why aren't you saying anything 
Why don't you try saying something 
Hey Hey 
Your excuse was a little short 
Then should I give you a longer explanation 
Give us another bottle 
It tastes so sweet So sweet 
I really like the rooftop of your place 
It's a perfect place to have a beer 
For now just a single pack 
Six beers 
Okay One pack 
We'll just start off with a pack 
One pack Six days 
I've bought myself that much time at least 
Woo Jin 
Gong Shil please help my mom 
No I don't want to 
I'm not going to look at you 
Gong Shil Please help me 
I'm not going 
Go away 
I said I'm not going 
Where did she go 
President Joo 
Why isn't she answering her phone 
Miss Aren't you going to answer your phone 
Found it 
Driver stop the car 
Woo Jin Mommy is coming to be with you 
Ma'am 
No you can't 
Please don't do this 
Let go 
Please don't do this 
Don't do this 
Please calm down 
You can't do this 
Woo Jin Woo Jin 
You can't do this 
It's too dangerous 
I want to go to him 
It's okay 
Woo Jin is standing next to her 
But I ended up following him again 
That's her life 
How can you expect yourself to handle all that 
I don't know 
I'll accept your decision 
Okay 
This ends right here 
It means that we'll easily forget one another 
I'm going to forget you 
No thanks 
I'm leaving 
But I haven't collapse and crumble 
What should I wear today 
Is everything prepared Yes 
How much 
This much 
This much 
Even bigger This much 
The thought of that gives me the butterflies 
What do you think of those two 
Well yes okay 
But 
But Bang Shil 
Why would he wait for her Well you know 
I'm waiting for the sun to rise again 
Oh no what to do 
I wonder if I was bewitched by a ghost 
We're here way too early for the meeting 
No you can't have any ice cream 
I'm hanging up 
No I'm actually waiting for someone 
You've been sitting here by yourself all night 
Well yes excuse me 
Would it be okay if I moved my seat 
Thank you 
This change is nice 
Excuse me Miss 
Would you like to have a drink with me 
No thanks 
Please go away 
You look so much like someone I know 
I said forget it 
You're really not going to look at me 
I'm here with someone 
Who 
A ghost 
Here you can have it 
You were seriously 
thinking of throwing it away 
Yes 
Yes Anyways I've already thrown it away 
Then should I throw it away too 
Are you in pain 
Yeah I'm in pain 
I feel like my back is splitting in half 
I thought you've fully recovered 
Have you ever been stabbed with a screwdriver 
Does it still hurt 
Let's get you home 
Yeah I think I need to go home 
Take me to the parking garage 
I'll go get someone to help you 
Aren't you being too harsh 
Okay let's go 
Do you know how much pain I was in 
Is that the best you can say 
Right there That's where it hurts 
You do the driving 
Me 
Unlock the door 
This is for my own safety 
Just concentrate on driving 
I have to concentrate on enduring my pain 
Start the car 
I'm sorry Han Na 
I think he went off to see Tae Gong Shil 
It's understandable that he would feel this way 
No Yes that's right 
I see 
I want to tell Joong Won who I truly am 
I'm sorry Hee Joo 
Didn't you tell me that I have a twin 
I want to go and find my sister 
My little sister is dead 
And I haven't seen Han Na again since that day 
Get some rest I'm going to get going now 
What would you like to drink 
I thought that you said you were in pain 
Okay fine Let's talk now since I'm here 
I don't want to end things with you 
I'm not going to end it 
Just remain by my side I'll handle everything 
Drink up 
I'm your defensive shield 
No that's not it 
So I no longer need to have a defensive shield 
But what am I 
Yes 
Then do you want to renegotiate our terms 
I told you that I don't want that 
I'm going to go now 
Okay you can go for now 
You do that 
You 
No don't quiver And don't get angry either 
We'll go back and renegotiate 
Just endure it 
Unclench your fist 
This is no fun 
I'm unattractive to her 
You're quick with your calculations 
Just name your price 
I will never block your sun from you again 
I'll try talking to Madame Go 
Excuse me 
You think that man is perfect 
But that man is still alive 
What are you thinking 
Just get lost 
I've signed a contract with her 
That's all over now 
She and I have come to a settlement 
There's no need for you to thank me 
Ah you settled it with her 
That's good 
Shafted 
Sacrifice devotion love 
Feelings like that only exist in fairy tales 
Mine was a very cruel fairytale 
Don't you remember what you once said to me 
But I don't understand it 
Grandmother what are you doing here again 
What are you doing 
Tell them to come back another time 
Your son is there doing that again 
That's very dangerous 
Okay let's go 
Where are you going 
Just go home 
This is the fourth time she told me to get lost 
I'm counting the number of times 
Grandmother it's okay 
I can handle it Is your son in a bad state 
What grandmother Tell me what's going on 
Right 
Why are you laughing 
What do you care You can't hear her anyways 
Yes you're right He is right 
There he is 
Mister 
Mister from the supermarket Mister 
Mister 
I can see him too 
How much did he have to drink 
Mister 
Mister from the supermarket 
National Singing Competition 
I won first place at that competition 
Yes you did 
Come on let's go 
What if he had a gun in his hand 
Would you have taken the bullet for me 
We don't see or hear the same things 
I must've turned into a street mutt 
You're still here 
What 
There's someone who wants to meet me 
Right now 
Who 
You came 
Gong Shil Do you remember who I am 
I know you 
I'm positive that I've seen you in my dreams 
It wasn't just a dream 
Because you're here 
Meeting you felt like a fresh ray of sunshine 
Master Joo are you awake 
I have my own world that I need to live in 
We stayed together for three whole years 
I've lived as a ghost for three whole years 
Is that why I'm able to see ghosts 
I don't know the exact reason for it myself 
Here 
He's telling me that I was there 
Want to go back to those places 
I guess you finally realized who I am Uncle 
Why did you do that 
Did something happen between you and Hee Joo 
Chief Secretary Kim 
When did you get back 
I got my memories back while you were gone 
Come into my office 
Master Joo 
What is it 
It's about Cha Hee Joo 
Did you find her twin sister 
Yes 
And those twin girls are my nieces 
Chief Secretary Kim is Cha Hee Joo's uncle 
Cha Hee Joo's older sister 
How interesting 
These are all the postcards you've sent 
Yes you're right 
You were in every city that I was in 
Have you been following me around 
Is that how it looks like 
Uncle 
Do you remember the emails you always sent me 
Although I never responded to any of them 
Yes she's right 
Uncle 
Han Na grew up in a very rich family 
She would never have done something like that 
Hee Joo was always the dark one 
And she was really greedy too 
That's Joo Joong Won 
I always thought that he looked like a prince 
I've liked him ever since I was little girl 
ended so tragically 
Then you told me that I wasn't the real thing 
How disappointing 
That's right 
You're a fake 
I'll be going back to England soon 
But everything turned into such a mess 
But 
I saw that the boy's scar ran very deep 
Enough Please stop 
When you first started 
I'll stop and leave your side 
Do that 
No 
I've seen Cha Hee Joo 
Hee Joo never once glanced in your direction 
I hear that you can see spirits 
You've seen dead Hee Joo's spirit 
Yes 
You don't think Han Na's the culprit do you 
Can you catch the culprit 
I really don't want to do it 
No 
I'm positive that she is the co conspirator 
We just need to find the evidence and catch her 
If she goes back to England it'll all be over 
I've found out everything that I want to know 
She said she wanted to protect her 
because Han Na was her older twin sister 
Cha Hee Joo is dead 
Leave 
President Joo 
I don't want to tell you to get lost too 
I've got my 10 billion won radar on 
I keep getting Hee Joo on my radar 
I saw Hee Joo during those moments 
And then I felt at peace 
I no longer hate Hee Joo 
Then does that mean it's all over 
I've continued to see Hee Joo 
It's probably why she remained by her side 
Tell her to keep doing that if she wants 
But still 
I just want to end it here 
But 
She was the criminal and I was the victim 
Okay 
You should live your life in peace 
Your radar is useless 
Tae Gong Shil 
But why are you starting to fight me on this 
I start to become useless to you 
But your life is more peaceful now 
This is unfair 
If I continue standing here looking at you 
Team Leader Kang are you really quitting 
Yes 
I heard that Chief Secretary Kim quit too 
Yes I think so 
Thanks for everything 
What a mess 
Then who is to become the Team Leader now 
I've decided to go to America 
Okay 
What about it 
Have dinner with me before I leave 
Okay 
Let's go eat 
I'll treat 
Eat as much as you'd like 
But it's simpler this way 
Forget it 
Just go and get me some more pickled radish 
Do I look like a high schooler to you 
Let's cheers 
This is weird 
I feel like I've been drinking 
Kang Woo 
I don't want to break up with you 
Have I been drinking alcohol 
I'm not trying to be stubborn 
I'm just not a very good drinker 
Don't you find me the least bit pretty 
Yes you're pretty 
Tae Yi Ryung is very pretty 
If she'd just call out my name just once 
But she won't call my name 
That's why I 
I don't want her to feel afraid anymore 
I want her to feel safe 
That's the only way 
I can stop being her bodyguard 
I don't want to protect you 
That's why I gave you alcohol 
Where are you saying that you're going to go 
Isn't this another country 
Are you going abroad 
Gong Ri 
He wants me to go there with him 
There's another person like you 
He really sees the things that you do 
Do you think Gong Shil 
will end up coming with me 
You were there from the beginning right 
What do you think will happen 
You're leaving much quicker than I expected 
I thought you were going to let me go 
But I'm not going to do that 
Give me back my necklace 
And get lost 
You seem to be convinced that I'm the culprit 
Don't involve that woman in this 
Do you want to die and be reunited with Hee Joo 
That woman must be very special to you 
Have you completely forgotten about Cha Hee Joo 
I guess seduction wasn't your forte 
Then I'll tell you the truth Joo Joong Won 
It was her older twin sister 
Han Na 
I'm leaving 
Help me I'm sorry 
You're Joo Joong Won right 
My name is Cha Hee Joo 
Ultimately she got you 
But in the end she lost that too 
Hee Joo ended up getting very angry 
That's why she did what she did 
I'm sorry for all this 
Joo Joong Won 
Cha Hee Joo did that all on her own 
You witnessed the moment of her death 
But which of the girls do you think is dead 
Was it Han Na or Hee Joo 
Who are you 
Are you Cha Hee Joo 
I told you I'm sweet Han Na 
It was that bitch Cha Hee Joo who died 
You said that the dead girl was a bitch 
You're 
Cha Hee Joo aren't you 
If not then I'm going to kill Joo Joong Won 
Please 
I need you to die as Cha Hee Joo 
No you're not it You're a fake 
Why are you acting like this now 
That's right She died because of you 
I'm Han Na 
You don't believe me 
Whatever the case 
I'm sorry for all this 
Cha Hee Joo 
What did you just call me 
Cha Hee Joo 
It's me Hee Joo 
What do you think that you're doing right now 
This is absurd 
Get away from me 
You don't believe me 
'Cha Hee Joo is going to die here ' 
'If not I'm going to kill Joo Joong Won ' 
'Please I need you to die as Cha Hee Joo ' 
I died as you and I allowed you to live as me 
Why have you come back Hee Joo 
Are you really Han Na 
Hee Joo Should we leave together 
I died because of you Isn't that right 
You can bring me back to life again 
Help me We're sisters 
Okay Let's leave together 
I'll help you 
This is great 
Don't run away just because you're afraid 
That's humiliating 
So why did you tell him everything 
Did you want to torment Joong Won 
But he told me that I was a fake 
What is it 
We're in middle of an operation 
Joong Won doesn't know who you really are 
Yes it is you 
That's right Since I'm the real Cha Hee Joo 
Let's go Han Na I'll protect you 
You 
You're not Han Na are you 
You dared to deceive me 
You caused Han Na's death 
There's no evidence to support your story 
Hee Joo 
But no one knows that 
I'm sorry for all this Han Na 
My older twin sister 
Hee Joo 
I will remain with you by your side 
It's all over Tae Gong Shil 
It really is all over 
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry 
Why are you crying 
Let's go I'll treat you 
I'm leaving 
Leave Leave to go where 
But when I'm with you 
Get lost my sun 
I guess it is you Tae Gong Shil 
Is your radar still working 
Can you still see ghosts 
Is your company a ghost 
I didn't want to meet you like this 
Really 
Yes 
That's why you can stop with the ghosts 
Have you been well 
I have been curious 
I was wondering if I should go see you 
So you at least were able to wonder about it 
I have been well 
I traveled here and there too 
I have changed 
You look like you've changed 
CEO 
Yes 
You're here for an appointment 
Yes a meeting that holds a lot of money 
Is Secretary Kim no longer with you 
Yes 
I guess you'll make a lot of money then 
I managed to make some money too 
I was so loaded with money I invested it 
So I even bought a house in England 
Yes I can't see them anymore 
Congratulations on turning off your radar 
Why 
No it's fine 
I told you I've changed now 
I guess so 
Congratulations really 
Thank you 
Let's see each other again at a good time 
Yes I did have that thought 
I'll be going first 
Final Episode 
Don't follow me 
You said you drank and even crashed 
Because of you everything got ruined 
Miss are you okay 
Mister take me to Mang uri 
I must go to Mang uri 
Before I go I have to buy a garden shear 
Where will I be able to buy one 
A shear 
Why 
A tree branch keeps poking me

Are you drunk 
There's no tree branch 
Mister have you ever lived in the ground 
Oh that scared me 
What what what 
Mister stop the car

That's perfect 
I can't go 
Take this wasted woman and get her out of here 
Let's go to Mang uri 
A ghost  came in 
Go away

I'll let that slide Tae Gong Shil 
Tae Yang are you awake 
I don't want to even if the sun is up 
Should I cooperate 
Come here 
What happened 
Why am I here 
You've really changed Tae Gong Shil 
I'm asking you what happened

Meow 
Darling 
That's my skincare not alcohol 
It's to apply on the skin you can't drink it 
I'm so lonely tonight 
Don't leave me alone 
Hey Parisian 
It's hard for me to even hold hands and sleep 
Just be satisfied with sleeping separately 
No 
Do you need me to speak in French for you 
No go away 
I'm really going crazy 
I really need to hold it in too 
I was just a drunk easy girl 
You were just drunk 
Whoever drinks gets drunk 
Yesterday you were just a drunk Tae Gong Shil 
I'm relieved 
Sorry 
Tae Gong Shil Tae Gong Shil 
I'll bring you water 
CEO I missed you 
It's absolutely not that 
I just really really really missed you a lot 
But I still see ghosts 
So that's why you didn't come to me 
I've been getting ready to seduce you 
After becoming an awesome and normal woman 
And after you fall for me 
I still see ghosts 
I wanted to tell you this 
It's important 
I even made a lot of the money you like 
I'm sorry I caused a ruckus 
Thank you for the tea 
Hey easy woman 
What do you mean make everything available 
I'm not an easy woman 
Okay then I'll correct it 
I took it on my own 
Don't call me 
I'll do it I've decided on that 
Can I send you texts 
Well if you want 
Thank you 
I'll be leaving then 
Tae Gong Shil try hard to seduce me 
Do everything you can 
Oh I must've been fine after drinking 
Oh what a relief 
Okay I'll bring him with me 
Tae Gong Shil 
What about Joong Won 
Really

Bang Shil fighting 
Yes 
My body condition is not that great either 
You're not going

My Joong Won is first and you're second 
It's a joke a joke 
Bang Shil Bang Shil Bang Shil 
I love you 
Honey 
Okay Gong Shil I'll go right after I'm done 
Tae Gong Shil came back 
Why 
So you can release your cheap mouth again 
Asking me when you already know 
Whatever Gong Shil does I'm on her side 
But if the Master knows he'll go crazy 
Gong Shil ruined a person 
Gong Ri you should take responsibility of me 
Why would I 
All those nights 
We were like that and this 
Those light lips 
Why are you talking about such things so loudly 
Well then do as you please 
Han Ju lina Gong Li Something like that 
Will they even do it for us 
I wonder if he'll go back to his Lorelei 
I'm worried about that too 
Why are you worrying about that 
Cake eat the cake 
It's sweet You too 
This this 
Why is this woman stuck onto a guard 
Why are all diplomats' wives so pretty 
Why did you take pictures 
It's me Kang Woo 
Hey Dog Manners 
Hey black whiskered whale 
Yeah 
Shouldn't I feel anxious 
Because this is protecting you in your position 
Kang Woo 
You said you were going to protect me okay 
Why 
Because that means your heart is mine now 
A movie 
We watched a movie already 
Not the night movies 
Let's see it at a film festival 
A film festival 
The red carpet 
Red carpet is too much 
It's a path you must pass through to protect me 
I'm someone who has to stand on that path 
Can't you stay by my side 
Right your side is that kind of place 
Let's go together Yes 
I told you to stay with me now 
Why are you coming back here 
Do you still see things 
That's not it 
Where is he now 
You're going to stay here now right

Unni I'm going to buy this place

I'm comfortable here 
And I think it's a good place to study 
Yeah 
He won't call too high of a price will he 
Well 
Oh here he comes 
Secretary Kim 
It's been a long time Tae Yang 
You're still really bright 
But what are you doing here 
Then the new owner is 
Yes I bought that place 
I'm just saying that 
When are you going to make the phone call 
Money's a little short 
I know him well He's a complete patsy 
I won't call yet 
I'm going 
Reply at least when I text you 
Yes 
Investment purpose is the first priority 
It's really hard to follow her way of things 
Waiting when there's something you must have 
I thought you didn't do that kind of thing 
I was like that originally 
Can I do that 
You had asked me to advise you while beside you 
Bravo 
Yes 
I haven't been feeling well lately 
Please tell me what it is 
Madam you're pregnant 
You're at 5 weeks Congratulations 
Me 
At my age 
I'm pregnant 
But I have it at this age 
Will I lose it 
You came from the hospital 
Are the test result not good 
No They're fine there's no problem 
That's a relief 
That 
Yeah it will be fun 
I will be full of thrill and dangerous 
Oh why 
You don't want to 
No 
Seong Ran 
You're still here 
It has been a long time 
Have you been well 
Tae Gong Shil 
Ahjussi you weren't talking to me 
Why 
Do you want to bargain over the building price 
While we're eating 
I ate lunch though 
Is that right 
I have a dinner appointment with my sis tonight 
Lately I get so many of these appointments 
So how many times have you eaten so far 
You did it huh 
I knew it 
You're worried aren't you 
Making a call 
I'll let it slip 
Yes 
You told me about all those nice plans 
So carry them out 
You know that I can still see them 
Yes 
Do you still hate yourself for doing that 
What's wrong 
Where are you going ahjusshi 
That's right 
I have to go 
I'm going too 
Tae Gong Shil 
It will be a truly satisfying wedding for you 
Yes it's nice 
It would be really nice to get married here 
Right Mom 
That must be his wife and daughter 
I guess so 
No 
He says no 
Her dad passed away 3 years ago 
It's because of that lottery 
Lottery 
Did he get a heart attack while being too happy 
He lost the lottery ticket 
Is this where he threw it away 
Your daughter is very pretty and nice 
It's nice here but it's too expensive Mom 
I'll have  the wedding  where we picked out 
Oh Mr CEO 
I haven't properly introduced myself 
I'm Kingdom's CEO Joo Joong Won 
Oh my You are 
In deeper sense he was my benefactor 
He was 
Dad was 
As a small token of gratitude 
I would like to help with your wedding 
Please accept it with a good heart 
As for the dress 
Please get them ready 
Yes 
They're so nice 
It's so pretty 
Dad thank you 
I still see ghosts 
You said you changed 
I made countless promises 
You really have changed 
Do you think she's stepped into the right path 
You have to go back too 
Life is a test 
Go back 
You Tae Gong Shil 
I didn't eat 
Oh really 
Then do you want to eat with me sometime 
Right now 
I'll call you 
Are you tantalizing me 
To test my patience 
You said you were friends with him 
Tae Gong Shil really has changed 
Call me 
You've come back after all 
Yes I've come back 
Are you planning to really lift him up and down 
You've changed Miss Tae Gong Shil 
Yes 
I see that you too have changed 
I haven't changed 
Not that 
You're holding another soul 
You 
You can tell such things too 
It's a very weak soul 
You should protect it well 
Don't let anyone know 
Don't tell Joong Won either 
I haven't decided what to do  with it  yet 
The choice is for each one to make 
I'm just talking about a person loving another 
You can't even compare them But you see 
I don't miss losing it at all 
You're right 
Isn't it incredible 
I'm seriously blinded by her brightness 
I'm asking if it will be possible 
Jump 
Give a kiss to mommy 
If I lose it 
Hey Kids 
Noona 
Are you guys moving 
Yeah We're going to a house with two bedrooms 
Really 
Are you living here again 
Yeah 
What about the special ahjussi 
What should I do with him 
Should I take him in 
But you can't do without him 
He couldn't even read 
He can read now 
But it's true that he can't do without me 
Kang Woo 
You've come back 
Yes I came back 
No 
I promised them I would help them with moving 
You help too 
We worked hard so let's have a drink for that 
Have you been doing well 
I saw an article about you and Yi Ryeong 
When I'm with her it's always a photo studio 
It would be so 
You should protect her well 
That's because to come back to the one I love 
Thanks Kang Woo 
For now I don't know if I have enough courage 
I'm a little scared 
Even I who see ghosts gathered up strength 
As for you gather up your courage 
Here 
Thanks 
I searched for more things to do on the trip 
Wind surfing looks good too 
And the skydiving it looks good 
Honey 
I am about to get up big courage 
Skydiving 
Do you think you can do it 
Why 
I have to have a baby 
What do you need to have 
Around 50 years of age 
Honey 
Honey 
I love you 
Since I have you 
I'll try my best 
Help with all you can 
Cheol Seok's mom 
Was it too much to ask as expected 
I try to visualize you 
Kang Woo 
That's right 
The scary red path 
I'll try walking on it with you 
If you get scared hold me 
Okay 
Here it is 
Now 
But CEO seriously didn't give me any discount 
At least he didn't raise the price 
So I satisfied the basic condition right 
Tae Yang 
If you hadn't stopped the car then 
I would not have been able to come this far 
Thank you 
French lady Are you by chance still here 
Wondering if she'll call me or not today 
Should I continue to put up with this or not 
Sun of death 
Be patient I'll pick up after 5 rings at least 
One 
You call me so fast after getting my number 
Were you waiting 
Yes 
Yes I've totally fallen for your scheme 
Will you come 
An invitation 
Will you come to me 
Then I too will formally accept it 
What should I do first 
Wash up first 
Wash up 
Make it as provocative as possible 
Tae Gong Shil fighting 
Into provocative clothes 
It's fine I like it 
Ah 
This building is mine 
Making your own fortune at a young age 
This land is worth a lot of money 
I admire you  speaking formally 
Sit down 
Here 
Wait 
To say this in advance before I have a drink 
I have a drinking habit 
Is that so 
I understand the precautions very well 
And as you might notice while we talk 
I might look other way or say things off topic 
I'm going to come to you and be by your side 
Because you're very special to me 
I'm Tae Gong Shil Tae Yang  Sun 
Can I rise up beside you 
Is that the main dialogue of this invitation 
I have no intention to do that 
I'm going to live continuously by your side 
I have never once let you go 
Thanks for never letting me go

I thought I was ready but I'm not 
I made a decision 
Don't let him leave the building 
Berger is still in the building What 
Which means he's waffling 
I got this 
Hey Larry 
How do you know my name 
My name's Dr Bishop It's my first day here 
Congratulations 
I'm leaving 
Hey wait wait wait wait wait 
Just hear me out Just for a second 
I just moved back here from L A 
I was there training under this Dr Pearlman 
Amazing surgeon Genius 
Also a very pious man 
And he taught me a lot of things 
It's from the talmud 
It means repairing the world 
Why are you telling me this 
before every surgery we did 
And I know you're scared 
I get that I really do I swear 
But I think it's something worth considering 
My mind's made up 
The answer's no 
I'm sorry 
So there's these um 
But one of the hinges was broken so they 
they kept that locked 
But he didn't know that 
And then bam 
There's like honey all over his beard 
I've come unstuck 
Let me 
Should you be doing this 
Why not 
Because I'm a 
What'd you say 
A beaker head with a God complex 
'Cause you're higher than a lab monkey 
What is going on here 
Relax Josh just popped his I V 
I got it back in 
No you can't do that 
The hell it isn't I'm a surgeon 
Not in here you're not 
Then what am I 
I'm sorry 
If I'm not a surgeon well what am I 
A dead duck 
That's That's what he said 
I didn't 
That's what you implied 
In here you're just my patient 
So what are my chances of surviving this 
Dr Kinney 
No seriously 
By Christmas 
That's not fair 
You stay out of this 
As your patient Dawson I am asking 
I don't feel comfortable answering that 
No Of course you don't 
I'm sorry I'm 
I didn't mean to be 
You're all good now Josh 
Thank you 
Okay then Um 
I'll be back in a bit to check on you both 
Where did you two meet 
Two total misfits 
Mine hardly even noticed I was gone 
She understood me 
Dr Harris 
Kurt 
Let's get him back to his room 
I don't believe it 
It's my fault I pushed him too hard 
It's no one's fault 
He's never been very good with surprises 
15 stitches 
I told you he'd come 'round 
You were right 
I am scared 
I've been scared my whole life 
You've always been this golden child 
Good grades 
Good friends 
We'll give you two some privacy 
I've always been this neurotic mess 
That's not true 
It is 
But you stood up for me 
We're in a good place Emma 
I don't want it to stop 
It won't 
You're my brother 
That is never gonna change 
What do we have 
A frozen kidney

Moment of truth 
Exactly 
Okay We got good perfusion 
Hey do you mind doing the ureter anastomosis 
You got it 
Thanks Bishop 
How did it go 
This is odd 
What 
He should be waking up now 
Heart rate's skyrocketing Alex 
He could be having a stroke 
Page shahir 
Let's get him up to imaging now 
Good catch Alex It was a stroke 
He's coning 
There That should relieve the pressure 
Alex it's okay 
You can go I've done plenty of these 
Turn up the music please 
I haven't told her yet 
That it's back 
Toughest thing in the world 
Watching your kid trying to be brave 
No matter how old they are 
Especially when you know the real truth 
Yeah I'd like to apologize for that 
No Why 
It's the truth 
Then I say we we double down on this 
Stranger on a train vibe we got going here 
Who goes first 
I don't know 
You want to rock paper scissors 
I'll go 
I don't want to do this again 
I want to get on a plane I want to fly away 
Your turn 
Well I want to come with you 
If looks could kill I'd be the ghost right now 
Well look at it this way 
So how do we help her if she won't talk to us 
I don't know 
Then what 
He won't move on either 
He won't get better 
That's a bit of a stretch don't you think 
Charlie 
I'm just saying it's not very scientific 
No look 
Illyana you need to talk to us 
He needs to be with me 
It was your time It's not his 
You need to accept that 
He won't make it without me 
He's gonna have to try 
I won't go without him I can't 
Something's wrong 
Illyana what are you doing 
I love him too much 
His heart rate's through the roof 
You need to go now 
I can't 
I won't 
He's got a petechial rash 
We need to get him to radiology right now 
Could be a fat embolus in his lungs 
Can you fix him 
I don't know 
Stop 
Call the code We need a crash cart 
Look Charlie 
Kurt never had a chance 
I'm not buying that Sorry

It doesn't sound so dangerous 
It shouldn't sound so easy either 
Just what kind of phenomena 
What's that typhoon in the middle of the map 
You'll see soon enough 
What the hell 
Only not this time 
You'll be armed: this is a regular war zone 
Leaving traces behind will not raise an issue 
And Snake this time you'll not be alone 
What 
Corporal Elizabeth Laeken former Delta 
Another mercenary 
40 kilometers of air corridor Time to go

Thing 
One of those game machines 
He comes from a family of great tradition 
Pierre here is his nephew 
Where to Big Chief 
Name 
Vitalij 
Characteristic traits 
Nasty filthy hairy A local 
Just relax Big Chief 
You shouldn't have any problem 
You want the lady just for yourself don't you 
What the hell has got into your head 
Later Big Chief 
I'm gonna KILL him 
Bye sister 
And say Hi to your next commander 
Elizabeth Laeken 
What was that stone for 
For reasons 
I hope you'll never discover 
Want to explain 
'course you don't 
Where did you find him 
I'd say right under our noses 
Well that's where he was staring at the wall 
Staring at the wall 
Thank God for me 
She knows her stuff 
Who is she 
You haven't briefed me yet 
Well Big Chief you have read my profile 
I can stand my ground 
Disgrace uhm 
What has she done 
Four missions abroad 
Goddammit 
She's stealth not a pathfinder 
Meaning what 
Fatal accidents drowning friendly fire 
The list is shocking 
Nine Officers 
And here she is 
I don't need any erratic behaviour from her 
I read your profile 
Nobody will come out of this a hero 
Ok we make camp 
How many died 
A million maybe more 
It has been one hundred years since now 
What about the present Government 
You're a democracy 
And this new war once again 
They're keeping something from us 
The Karabakh region is full of oil 
Yes that I know 
But Karabakh is far from here down South 
Daskasan 
Daskasan doesn't count for anything 
I don't understand 
It is not just war 
That is 
The fiend of Kalcabar 
To think I'd have laughed at myself before 
I am not superstitious 
I don't believe in anything my eyes can't see 
But my family is over there my home 
And the stories I've heard 
Entire villages found empty at dawn and then 
The people are found dead in the forest 
We are in God's hands now 
Damn you ARE cool aren't you 
You'd make a good videogame character 
No shit man 
A Nintendo platformer I'd say 
Nah forget it 
It's just a joke you wouldn't get it 
You're so OLD man 
She's some woman isn't she 
And have you seen her ASS 
Word of advice Big Chief live 
What do you think 
About what 
The boy You don't dig him do you 
He's unreliable 
He's one of the best in his field 
He has no discipline 
You still have to see him in action 
He doesn't take anything seriously 
I envy him He still has to grow up 
We are professionals the two of us 
Yeah that we are

Sir sir can your wife identify this man 
Ma'am 
You startled me 
Oh I'm sorry 
What happened 
I tore my 
On the cactus I 
Oh I'm sorry 
It was very clumsy of me 
I'm sorry about that 
Yes ma'am you do 
I was a little drunk Lt Columbo 
Oh isn't it perfectly awful 
Janice Caldwell had so much to give 
I'm sure she'd have found her way 
Yes ma'am 
That's what I wanted to ask you about 
You being close friends and all 
Well that is that she 
Well they were having problems 
Was she seeing other men 
Is that what you wanted to know 
Uh yes ma'am 
Surely that can't make any difference now 
Once last year I I did try talking to her 
She became very defensive almost violent 
Then she was seeing other men 
Yes 
Young men I believe Men I didn't know 
Thank you ma'am You've been very helpful 
Uh Mrs Halperin one other thing 
Last night the burglar 
Your husband gave us a description 
He saw him running from the Caldwell house 
Yes from our bedroom window 
Now I understand you were also in the bedroom 
Oh I I didn't see him 
By the time I got to the terrace he had gone 
You weren't at the window 
No 
Where were you 
Thank you ma'am 
Uh one other thing Mrs Halperin 
Yes Right across the street Number 1278 
I I was just trying to visualize the proximity 
Thank you 
Excuse me sir A police officer to see you 
Yes Uh would you ask him to come in please 
Lt Columbo 
Yes Lieutenant 
My maid said you were here earlier 
I hate to bother you like this 
Like a cup of coffee Lieutenant 
No 
Thank you very much 
Is there uh 
Something wrong Lieutenant 
Wrong No sir 
Not at all 
Satisfy yourself how 
The way your wife died Mr Caldwell 
I spoke to your maid Mrs Um 
Fernandez 
She's a nice lady 
I guess she worked very long hours yesterday 
It must have been a big cleaning day 
Well I really wouldn't know 
Apparently your wife was out shopping all day 
Mrs Fernandez left here at uh 
Oh it was after 8:00 Lieutenant 
Your wife was downstairs 
Right In the living room having a drink 
Mrs Fernandez says she was wearing a red dress 
Yes I believe it was 
I see 
And then you went out 9:00 
Yes 
Was your wife still wearing the red dress 
Yes Lieutenant 
Look we had a couple of drinks I left 
At the club 
That's right Lieutenant 
Look Janice apparently went upstairs to change 
I mean 
It's very strange 
See there's one thing that's very strange 
And what's that Lieutenant 
Mrs Fernandez dusted the whole house 
Wax polish everything 
Including the bedroom 
Your wife's prints weren't on it 
That's very simple Lieutenant 
Don't you see 
She had no reason to go to the closet 
Yes Yes I see 
That would explain it Yes it certainly would 
Well thank you 
No not at all Lieutenant 
Excuse me sir Sir 
Ma'am Excuse me ma'am 
You got some jumpers for a battery 
No 
Listen there's a gas station up ahead 
Would you drive me over there 
Thank you 
Columbo 
Excuse me sir I didn't mean to barge in 
I looked for your secretary 
I guess she's powdering her nose or something 
May I uh 
I'm making real progress So I thought 
Finish your report 
No I haven't 
Well finish the report and I'll read it 
I'm on that chopper patrol tonight 
I understand sir 
Just take a minute I know you're in a hurry 
It was hardly a description 
I barely got a glimpse of him 
Right 
You did say uh dark sweater 
Mark  That's right 
Dark pants 
And some kind of cap 
And a dark cap 
Dark cap 
That's it then Just dark 
It was night Lieutenant 
And I was a long way away 
Uh that's too bad 
That's what your wife said 
You spoke to my wife did you 
I thought you left 
What was that you said 
I say you spoke to my wife 
Yes there's nothing wrong 
No Certainly not 
I thought that she also saw the burglar 
That's ridiculous 
He was gone by the time she got to the terrace 
Yes sir That's what she said 
Look Lieutenant if you don't mind 
I've got to go now my limousine is waiting 
There are a couple of other things 
Give my secretary a call in the morning 
I'll try to find some time for you 
Oh Mark you frightened me 
What are you doing home so early 
Oh I thought I'd get an early supper 
Please leave the room darling 
You know I like to bathe in private 
Come on Margaret Don't be so coy 
Come on Mark I'll only be a minute 
Huh Have I

Where's Margaret 
She's at home 
A closed casket huh 
Couldn't bear to look her in the face 
Mark I don't know how to thank you 
If it hadn't been for you last night 
You'd be facing a murder charge 
If there's anything I can ever do for you 
There is my friend 
Tonight 
I left Margaret at home 
She's dead 
Good Lord Mark 
Whispering  Quiet 
How 
She drowned in the bathtub 
Only the police are never gonna know that 
And you must see to that 
What are you talking about 
I can't get involved 
You are involved my friend 
You killed your wife and I protected you 
Yes perfectly 
All right 
Here's what I want you to do 
This is Chopper One This is Chopper One

The Commissioner how's he holding up 
They got him in the kitchen 
They're putting some dry clothes on him now 
It's not too bad I tell you 
The burglar huh 
Yeah It's funny though Very funny 
What 
Randall  Lieutenant 
Excuse me Columbo 
Lt Duffy sir Yes sir 
Doyle  Just keep circling around 
He's got to be around here somewhere 
Yeah well keep looking 
That's right 
Columbo  What happened Doc 
See for yourself Columbo She drowned 
In a pool 
Guy tossed her in a pool 
That's it 
Wonder why she didn't swim 
Probably couldn't swim 
Well maybe she passed out Lieutenant 
What are we gonna do 
He didn't hit her first 
No marks No struggle 
officer  Hey Doyle 
Yeah Yeah 
No that happened this afternoon 
officer  This guy just pulled up out front 
Al  I've come to see Ms Halperin 
officer  What about 
The way things look around here 
I'd like to get out of here 
What did you say A meeting 
She was supposed to get an award 
Yeah Holcombe House 
Gonna have dinner at 8:00 
I called her house when she didn't show 
Line was always busy so I came over 
Where were you at 7:30 
I was at the place setting' up 
Relax huh You're making me nervous 
You can prove it right 
Prove it 
Yeah I can prove it 
I'll bet you can 
All right Doyle 
Take this gentleman's name and let him go 
Don't talk to me about manpower allocations 
Now this man killed my wife and I want him 
You're gonna answer to me in the morning 
Excuse me Commissioner 
I just want to tell you how badly I feel 
And if there's anything that I can do 
No no thank you 
Mark I want you to take those pills 
What 
I want you to take the pills that I gave you 
All right I'll take the pills 
I'm shocked 
Terribly shocking 
The man is obviously insane 
I mean to come back here and do this 
Don't you see 
It was the news broadcast that killed her 
It was my fault 
I don't follow sir 
He must have thought she could identify him 
That's the reason he came back 
Not to steal anything but to silence her 
Yes that is a possibility 
The tragedy is she never saw him 
She couldn't identify him 
You mustn't blame yourself sir 
He threw her in the pool 
She drowned before I could reach her 
He threw her in the pool 
Are you sure of that sir 
Of course I'm sure of it I was a witness 
Then you had the light on 
It was kind of a gut feeling I suppose 
I switched on the lights and there he was 
The same man holding Margaret in his arms 
Are you sure it was the same man 
Well assumedly 
Yes he was wearing the same clothes 
I see 
You must have a lot of those 
What 
Gut feelings 
What are you talking about 
Well you had a gut feeling last night 
I don't know what you're talking about 
What do you mean 
Yes 
I did 
I didn't 
Didn't know obviously 
Well I I did have some kind of a feeling 
I sensed something was wrong 
Well the lights were on for one thing 
Yes I know exactly what you feel 
I've had that feeling many times 
All right sir 
Columbo 
Yeah go ahead 
What's the matter Columbo 
You think he's hiding in the tub there 
Columbo  Just checkin' 
Yeah 
What did you find 
Columbo  Clean and dry 
Clean and dry 
Let me ask you somethin' 
How do you figure this guy 
Haven't you ever heard of future shock 
The world's going to hell with itself 
Believe me Columbo Times have changed 
Yeah 
Maybe 
But still 
You mean the Caldwell woman 
Yeah 
I uh I looked at her body 
Now I gotta ask myself this question 
You're something else 
Don't you think we thought of that 
It's a phony 
The ring was phony 
Solid glass A piece of garbage 
Excuse me one moment will you 
Yeah I guess that explains it 
See here I am 
Glass 
How do you like that 
Listen Doc do me a favor Would you 
There won't be 
Sure if the bathtub were full of gin 
Well check it anyway would you 
It's part of the job 
Yes 
woman  Lt Columbo sir 
All right send him in 
I hope I'm not disturbing you sir 
No it's all right Come in 
This is none of my business 
I want to be here Lieutenant 
I want to keep working keep my mind off 
All right let's see 
Oh and speaking of reports 
That's what I wanted to talk to you about 
What 
No sir 
What are you talking about Columbo 
Here read Duffy's report 
Like what 
Oh for one thing the fingerprints 
That's what I mean sir 
This is what bothers me sir 
Now that's strange isn't it 
Including the phones 
All right what are you implying 
Yeah 
No sir 
Why not 
Well because the burglar had to wear gloves 
You see sir 
Now there's another thing that's very strange 
Is this bothering you 
No 
Excuse me 
There's something else 
She didn't do that 
Somebody else dressed her in that nightgown 
Is that a fact Lieutenant 
Or just some more of your fancy guesswork 
And you know something 
I don't see what you're getting at 
Oh no sir No I don't mean that at all 
No You see 
I saw a pink nightgown under the pillow 
Now here's what's interesting 
No sir we're looking for somebody else 
Like who for instance 
Well sir 
And you think it was one of them 
Yes sir I think that's a possibility 
Especially now 
You don't think that 
I have anything here 
Lieutenant nobody can be right all the time 
Look for your burglar There's the killer 
Excuse me uh 
Mr Wexler 
He's inside with a customer for the moment 
Oh thank you 
We can smoke here 
Yes 
May I help you sir 
No thank you very much 
No I am waiting for Mr Wexler 
Mr Wexler is servicing a client at the moment 
If there's anything I can do 
No thank you 
Oh excuse me ma'am Do you happen to 
Of course 
I broke this a couple of weeks ago 
I've been carrying it with me 
This is a very good watch only five years old 
Waterproof and shockproof 
Do you have something for that 
Seven jewels 
We have a large selection sir starting at $25 
No I don't want a watch just the band 
That is for just the band 
No kidding 
Thank you 
Mr Wexler 
Wexler  I'm Bruno Wexler yes 
Lieutenant Columbo 
I believe she shopped here in your store 
Mrs Caldwell was a valued client yes 
Of course that was some time ago 
Well I would have to check back 
I mean even though she didn't buy anything 
Lieutenant could you get to the point 
May I sit down 
Of course 
This is the point sir 
Yes 
It's glass 
I can see that it's glass 
But this appraisal for $8 000 for a 3 6 
This appraisal is for that ring isn't it 
But that is your work isn't it 
Yes Lieutenant 
The woman needed money 
Her husband had cut off her funds 
Then all the jewelry in her house was phony 
Almost all of it Yes 
Why did she need the money 
Really Lieutenant 
I understood she had a lot of boyfriends 
Yes indeed 
That's a real honey 
Especially in this condition 
Well I try to take good care of it 
I'm Mr Shoup 
Charlie Shoup 
My name is Columbo 
How many miles you got on it Mr Columbo 
20 000 30 000 tops 
Oh I got over 100 000 miles on this car 
That's pretty hard to believe 
Police 
Look I just work here 
You got a beef 
Go see the boss 
Good lookin' watch 
Thanks 
I'm here to talk about a Janice Caldwell 
Did she give you that watch 
That was the night Janice was killed 
Tuesday evening 
When she didn't show up 
Figured I'd been stood up So I 
There was no answer 
No sir 
What time 
Around 9:30 
Go on 
Well like I said I figured I'd been stood up 
You can substantiate that 
She's right inside Lieutenant 
Ask for Shirley 
That won't be necessary Thank you very much 
You've been very helpful 
Lieutenant 
I'll give you $80 for it in a trade 
It's all right Come in Lieutenant 
Thank you sir 
Let me tell you what happened 
My car let me down again 
They let me use another one 
Well 
Well what 
Where is it the report 
That's the problem 
Look Columbo I'm a little bit tired 
May I explain the problem sir 
Just give me a moment 
You've had a lot of experience 
You happen to know this woman 
Mrs Caldwell She was your neighbor 
I'm trying to figure it out 
If you could just give me a moment 
All right Come on 
Thank you sir 
You want a cognac 
This is complicated 
See whether or not you can help me with this 
Janice Caldwell died between 10:30 and 11:00 
Right 
That's correct 
That's why I can't start the report 
Why 
I get stuck in the beginning the time of death 
What are you talking about Columbo 
Janice Caldwell had a boyfriend 
She was supposed to meet him at 9:30 
She never showed up 
So she stood him up So what 
You know what I wrote down 
Maybe she was dead already 
You follow my thinking 
Maybe she just didn't want to talk to the man 
Did that occur to you 
You see the contradiction 
But did she pick up the phone at 10:30 
You see how confusing it gets 
That's why I keep going back to this 
Maybe she was dead already 
That explains why she doesn't answer the phone 
It was a fake call 
I did say that sir 
Provide him with an alibi 
Snickering  I see I get it 
Is that right Is that the next step 
You know Columbo I really 
I really do admire your enthusiasm 
The force could use a 100 like you 
But this theory is a crock 
Columbo  You think so sir 
Now that's the theory we're gonna go on 
Is that clear 
That's an order 
Yes sir 
All right 
I want you to concentrate on his leads 
I promise you 
The burglar 
Sir in that connection 
I uh I spoke to a Mr Wexler today 
Well you're tired 
Not important 
Good night sir 
Good night 
dispatcher  194 194 
Come in 194 
This is 194 
Can you patch me through 
Stand by 
Go ahead

I want to see him by this afternoon Yes sir 
Columbo  Lieutenant Duffy 
Oh Columbo

Thought you would 
I spoke to the Commissioner last night 
Come on inside Columbo 
You know the most likely suspects 
Take your pick 
You sure 
Columbo these guys are like old friends 
Very placid and predictable types 
Let me ask you something 
Leave out the last two murders 
Just concentrate on the first three robberies 
That's easy The guy on top Artie Jessup 
Take a look for yourself 
You know I think old Artie prefers prison life 
He's very nervous out here with us civilians 
We've already talked to him We can't hold him 
Why not 
Mr Jessup 
Do I know you 
I stopped by your place 
Your wife told me you were here 
My what 
My wife 
You got Scotch 
Yes sir 
You like Scotch 
She wishes 
Give him some Scotch 
Thought maybe you could help me 
Suppose I wanted a few dollars for that 
It's not real 
Come on pal what is this some kind of hustle 
A cop 
I must be getting old 
I'm not from Robbery 
I'm from Homicide 
Oh no 
Oh no 
You're not going to hang that one on me 
No way No way 
Where's my jacket 
You wanna book me go ahead book me 
Where's my jacket

Sit down 
I don't wanna sit down 
May I sit down 
Go ahead 
You had nothing to do with it 
That's what I'm here for 
I can't help you 
You haven't heard anything 
Nothing 
You're sure 
Do you know I'm afraid of Siamese cats 
I mean he really scares me 
Otherwise you wouldn't be down here 
Right 
Right 
Would you rob a thing like this 
Are you kidding 
They'd laugh me off the cellblock 
All right listen to me Artie 
I got a problem You can help me 
Me 
I think I know who killed those two women 
But I can't prove it 
man  Hey Artie it's your old lady 
Tell that bag to go 
Tell her I'll be home in a little while 
You know who killed those women 
Come on Hugh make sense Who wants money 
The man The burglar 
That's ridiculous 
Mark he's dead serious 
But how does he know you killed Janice 
Hugh  I don't know I don't know 
The point is that he knows 
You did call the police my friend 
How much does he want 
I don't know I don't know 
Said he'd tell me later today 
When are you supposed to meet him 
Uh 4:30 
A bar at Fifth and Wall 
All right meet him 
I'll be waiting nearby 
All right no violence 
Why Hugh 
I'm no more violent than you are 
But I figure you know that already don't you 
I don't know what you're talking about 
Don't hand me that 
It's gonna cost you 
You still haven't given me proof 
I don't need any proof 
Now what do you think 
I think they got you 
Hey I don't mind one way or the other 
I won't mind that a bit Now come on 
What's it going to be pal 
All right 
How much 
Good 
Well 
He wants $5 000 in small bills Old money 
Nothing larger than a $50 
$5 000 is that all 
The man has no imagination 
When do you meet him 
Tomorrow afternoon here 
Same time 
Right Now Mark he's dead serious 
He's not a stupid man 
I want you to be here tomorrow at the same time 
Mark we can't start paying him 
He's just gonna want more 
Just leave him to me 
We're gonna be just fine 
Both of us 
Oh Columbo What are you doing here 
Oh good morning sir

Lt Duffy is out on call I'm using his office 
What's the matter with your office 
Well I was going through these file folders

I think the answer lies right in here somewhere 
Good 
Good 
Still you never know do you 
That's a good thought 
Sometimes something just clicks into place 
Well on the other hand 
I've been through these a dozen times 
I don't think they can help me any

No sense wasting your time on a dead end

What she was wearing the tear in her dress 
You see I had asked myself the question 
Got a whole closet full of nice clothes 
Now I find out about the soap 
That places it in the bathtub 
Yes sir 
But that was based on your eyewitness testimony 
Now I spoke to him 
All right Suppose she did die in the bathtub 
Jessup surprised and killed her 
No sir that's not possible 
You know why 
Including the towels not even slightly moist 
That was the first thing I checked sir 
Long before Jessup got there

O Allah as I lie here wounded my spirit broken 
The sentence I've to serve is in your words: 
As the months went by our relationship deepened 
Why would he 
You are going to marry Aziz; 
Ever since then I recoil from his touch 
They ask thee concerning women's courses 
Say: they are a hurt and a pollution 
But when they have purified themselves 
For Allah loves those who turn to him constantly 
O Allah most high 
O Allah most high 
he accuses me of being ungrateful to him; 
O Allah most gracious most merciful 
and then only with my father's permission 
Once in a while I sin 
In general I am happy with my life 
That doesn't stop him though 
I am filled with guilt and shame; 
O Allah giver and taker of life 
The women whose sin was motherhood

Dreamland 
Shopping 
Off for a spin 
Sin creeps in 
Welcome to our city 
The trouble begins 
Vamp him 
Innocence 
Getting flighty 
Her sweetheart arrives 
Jealousy 
The End 
Nosferatu 
Here is the story: 
Not so hasty my young friend 
No one escapes his destiny 
You could make a nice bit of money 
He wants a handsome deserted house 
That house just opposite yours 
Offer him that 
Leave at once my young friend 
Have a quick journey into the land of phantoms 
Do not fear 
The Book of the Vampires 
Drive on 
The sun is setting 
We will go no further Not for a fortune 
We will go no further 
Here begins the land of the phantoms 
You are late young man 
Blood 
Your precious blood 
Your wife has a beautiful neck 
At the same hour 
Ellen 
Fetch a doctor a doctor 
Thomas 
A harmless blood condition 
Ellen Ellen 
He is still feverish 
Coffins 
The ship must set sail this night 
Is it not 
like a vampire 
Blood is life 
Blood is life 
And this one 
a polyp with tentacles 
Transparent almost without substance 
No more than a phantom 
New Plague Baffles Science 
Like an epidemic it spread over the entire ship 
I shall go down 
The ship of death had a new captain 
I must go to him 
He is approaching 
The Master is coming 
The Master is here

Look 
Every night in front of me 
Panic seized the people 
Who was sick or dying 
Who would be stricken tomorrow 
I shall run over there quickly 
I shall get Sievers 
They saw him escape he strangled his keeper 
He strangled him The vampire 
Bulwer 
Fetch Bulwer 
Master 
Master 
Beware 
The master is dead 
Thomas 
And the miracle shall be told in truth 
The End 
PART ONE 
THE MEN AND THE MAGGOTS 
Revolution is war 
Of all the wars known in history 
great war 
In Russia 
this war has been declared and begun 
Lenin 1905 
The men slept heavily after the watch 
Watchful but clumsy 
It is easy to vent one's rage on a recruit 
There's a limit to what a man can take 
The time has come for us to speak out 
What are we waiting for 
All of Russia has risen 
Are we to be the last to do so 
On the following morning 
We've had enough rotten meat 
It's not fit for pigs 
Ship's doctor Smirnov 
The meat could crawl overboard on its own 
Those are not worms 
They are only maggots 
Wash them out with brine 
Russian POW's in Japan are fed better 
We've had enough rotten meat 
Stop that talk It's good meat 
Gilyarovsky a senior officer 
Boiling soup 
The men seethed with rage 
The ship's store 
The men refused to eat the soup 
Give us this day our daily bread 
PART TWO 
DRAMA IN THE HARBOUR 
All hands on deck 
Ship's captain Golikov 
All who enjoyed their soup 
step forward 
The pretty officers 
Step back 
I'll string the rest of you up on the yard 
Call the guard 
To the turret 
To the turret 
To the turret 
Shipmates 
It's time 
Most of the men gathered by the turret 
Halt 
Stay where you are 
Back 
The hatch is not for the likes of you 
I'll shoot you down like dogs 
Cover them with tarpaulin 
Aye aye sir 
Cover them 
Attention 
Bring the unruly to reason O Lord 
At the tarpaulin 
Fire 
Brothers 
Who are you shooting at 
The rifles wavered 
Fire 
Fire 
Fire you swine 
Take your rifles mates 
Let those blackguards have it 
Give it to them 
Remember the Lord 
Out of my way 
He's gone to feed the fishes 
We've won mates 
To the shore 
Odessa 
A tent on the new pier 
Killed for a plate of soup 
PART THREE 
A DEAD MAN CALLS FOR JUSTICE 
A mist spread over the sea 
A rumour spread from the pier 
The news reached town with the sunrise 
An uprising 
And a dead sailor 
is lying on the shore 
We won't forget 
Killed for a plate of soup 
People of Odessa 
Prince of Tauride 
Death to the opressors 
We shall take revenge 
The ship's crew 
All for one 
And one for all 
Down with the butchers 
Down with tsarism 
Mothers sisters brothers 
Let nothing divide us 
Kill the Jews 
Shoulder to shoulder 
The land is ours 
The future is ours 
Delegates from Odessa 
We must deal the enemy a decisive blow 
Together with the workers of Russia 
we shall fight and win 
Odessa followed the progress of the uprising 
PART FOUR 
THE ODESSA STAIRCASE 
Odessa was with the sailors 
Boats streamed to the battleship 
Suddenly 
Let's go and talk them out of it 
Do you hear that 
 
Don't shoot 
My boy is very ill 
The Cossacks 
The ship's guns roared in reply to the massacre 
The target the Odessa Opera House 
At the enemy stronghold 
Stormy meetings went on all day 
Odessa awaits her liberators 
If you land the troops will join you 
The flag squadron is moving on us 
Night fell a night fraught with anxiety 
The squadron approached in the dark 
The men were silent 
Squadron sighted 
All hands on deck 
To action stations 
Full steam ahead 
Meet them head on 
Full steam ahead 
The Potemkin was escorted By destroyer 267 
The attack began 
The squadron bore down on the battleship 
Signal to them to join us 
Join us 
The enemy is within firing range 
All against one 
One against all 
Will they open fire 
Brothers 
Hurrah 
A thunderous hurrah rang out 
THE END 
Subtitles by Ankit Bhageria 
Beckoning thousands to her unknown regions 
Many lost their lives 
But the brave went on 
Now let me see thought the little fellow 
Before I know where I am I must get there 
Eureka 
I've found it a mountain of gold 
But the elements laughed roared and thundered 
Come here said Larson 
What are you doing 
Eating obviously 
Get out 
Go on 
Get out 
The wind also was giving Big Jim his troubles 
Big Jim was the noble type He had suffered 
Get out said Black Larson 
Or I'll fill you both full of lead 
Now then the pair of you get out 
Out 
That kind of noise Jim don't tolerate 
I'll stay right here understand 
Right here said Big Jim 
Understand 
We stay right here 
And stay they did for days and nights 
I must have food yelled Big Jim 
I must have food 
What are you eating said Black Larson 
Nothing 
Open your mouth 
Liar 
It's that candle 
That said the Little Fellow How revolting 
Come here the pair of you 
We'll cut the cards and the low man goes 
You're the man said Jim 
Goodbye good luck 
Don't forget to bring home the bacon 
Not quite done yet give it two more minutes 
Come on come on said Big Jim 
From the pangs of hunger 
Big Jim was becoming delirious hysterical 
In fact he was a pain in the neck 
Food food he thundered 
I can put another shoe in the pot 
No no anything but that 
Poor Jim he couldn't take it 
What's the matter said the Little Fellow 
I thought you were a chicken 
Well build up the fire said Big Jim 
Come my pretty bird said Big Jim 
Don't be childish 
Hey quit it Don't be foolish it's me 
You said Jim 
I'm sorry 
I must be crazy 
You're telling me said the Little Fellow 
You go inside 
I'll take the gun in case you lose it 
Then came the parting of the ways 
Big Jim to his mine our hero to his fate 
Goodbye said the Little Fellow 
It's been a great pleasure knowing you 
Caught in a maelstrom of desperate deeds 
Black Larson swept on to impending doom 
Georgia 
Jack was a ladies' man 
Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia 
Perhaps that's why she resented him 
Georgia why aren't you nice to Jack 
I believe he really likes you said the girl 
I'm bored with this place she continued 
Don't worry I'll find him someday 
Kinda fresh ain't ya thought Jack 
Get down off that high horse 
Me and you are gonna dance 
Hey there pan out a tune 
Just a moment I said we're gonna dance 
I beg your pardon said Georgia 
Hey you come here 
Yes you 
Do you want to dance 
If you wanna make a hit with your lady friend 
Take that you Ouch 
Huh Very good 
Hank's partner arrives 
Both are ready to leave on a long expedition 
He knew she was fooling but he was happy 
Nice place you have here said Georgia 
I hope you will invite us again 
What if she were fooling 
He was enjoying the warmth of her attention 
And now she was leaving 
The light of her loveliness would be gone 
Pardon me said the Little Fellow 
But uh He was lost for words 
Would you really like to come again 
Very well said Georgia 
We'll come to dinner New Year's Eve 
The eve of a new year New hopes and new dreams 
And the girls called for a speech 
But he was too happy to speak 
All that mattered was Georgia was there 
Georgia 
So he muttered and stuttered and finally said 
I can't make a speech but I'll do a dance 
And a dance he did with the rolls 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
And never brought to mind 
Should auld acquaintance be forgot 
We'll have some fun with him said Jack 
Oh forget it said Jack 
How about giving me a little attention 
A day or so later in the Recorder's office 
Where is this place they said 
But Big Jim's memory had failed him 
All he knew was that it was near the cabin 
The cabin that's it 
But I can't remember 
The Little Fellow knew otherwise 
How dare that cad mention her name so lightly 
For two pins he'd give him another thrashing 
Georgia had written him a letter 
You you said Big Jim 
You 
The very man I've been looking for 
The cabin the cabin 
Where is it 
Answer me I say 
Can't you speak man 
Tell me 
Where's the cabin 
Where is it 
At last I shall find my mountain of gold 
To your feet man quick 
You're coming with me 
Georgia 
Just a moment said the Little Fellow 
I love you I'll take you away from this life 
I'm going away and when I return 
I shall come back 
Ah said Big Jim it won't be long now 
Then came the dawn 
This is the worst liver attack I've ever had 
Feel that rocking 
It's the stomach 
It's not the stomach 
Let's go to the other side 
We'll see how far it will go over 
Something must be missing underneath 
I'll go outside and see what it is 
Now said Big Jim don't get excited 
Take it easy don't move don't breathe 
I said don't breathe stupid 
You can be most annoying at times 
If you'll only be cool be calm said Big Jim 
We have nothing to worry about 
Now listen I've got a very good idea 
You see what I mean said Big Jim 
Your mind is chaotic You have no psychology 
You have no control 
And Big Jim discovered his claim 
Now we shall be rich said Jim 
We shall be millionaires 
And so they were 
They were famous and sought after by the press 
And Big Jim was manicured 
Not the nails said he the corns 
It would make a human story 
Georgia 
You said Georgia 
I thought I'd never see you again 
And then she mistook him for the stowaway 
The officer was going to put him in irons 
Heck said the Captain That's no stowaway 
Then of course there were apologies 
The Little Fellow gathered himself together 
Oh you don't say Well congratulations 
And so it was 
A happy ending

She be came my wife 
Tell me what happened next

I agree It 's getting too dangerous 
Dr Tanaka 
Are you okay

Stark 
where are we 
who knows 
From what I see I'd say we've been kidnapped 
But if so why's that door open 
No guards either It doesn't add up 
So Doc any idea where the heck we might be 
Actually yes 
what's going on 
what the hell is this crap 
Are you all right 
I'd be dead in a few minutes without my reactor 
who could 've done this to you 
It's been a while hasn't it Stark 
I knew it 
You've been alive this whole time 
well it depends on how you look at it 
what does that mean 
The man you see here now is part of the Zodiac 
I don't believe that You'd never join Zodiac 
what the 
I gave you life once why not take it back huh

The Zodiac needs someone with such a talent 
Cut the crap

Let's get the hell out of here 
It's best you lie down 
I feel weak I'm sorry 
without my reactor I feel worthless 
what do you mean 
That's very impressive I really mean it 
But that can wait 
So what's next 
I saw a yacht hidden in that cove over there 
But what if we get attacked like last time 
Unless we have a weapon 
Yeah but I wouldn't create a weapon

Nanami wake up

He's taking too long this time what's he up to 
Something's wrong

Kill your enemy 
Immerse your self in blood 
Go on obliterate the enemy

Captain Sakurai 
So it was you 
Nanami

I'll bet it's Mary Smith 
I'll bet it isn't 
Well Mary you found your little lamb 
Now I'm gonna follow you wherever you go 
Gee we're alone 
And our day is almost over 
Oh it isn't over 
It's just beginning 
For I'm going to make you a promise 
Promise what 
That we'll never be lonesome anymore 
I'd have proposed to you right on the spot 
I I would have accepted 
I don't like blue shingles 
But you like the white house 
And I'd paint the shingles any color you like 
Lavender 
Sure 
Or pink 
Oh Mary I'd rather have them blue 
Then they'd be just the color of your eyes 
Mary 
Mary 
Gee that's a pretty name 
But Sergeant I — 
Calm yourself baby 
I'll get to you in a moment 
Now tell me where you found him 
A jane was hurt down at the roller coaster 
This monkey tried to run over me about it 
Disturbing the peace eh kiddo 
Oh listen to me Sergeant 
That's what I was trying to tell this man: 
that it was my girl that was hurt 
I was trying to get to her to help her 
So it was your girl that was hurt eh 
What is her name 
Mary sir 
Mary what 
I 
I don't know 
You see we only met today 
Picked her up eh 
Oh no sir 
You wouldn't say that if you saw her 
She's not that kind of a girl 
She's a good kid a sweet kid 
That ain't much of a description 
Take him away 
I don't know that girl's name but I love her 
And if I don't get to her I'll lose her 
And I'm gonna marry her if she'll have me

Don't mind me I'm just playful today 
Now run along 
Thanks 
Hey you go jump in the lake 
I'll be loving you always 
With a love that's true always 
I will understand always 
Always Days may not be fair always 
That's when I'll be there always 
Not for just an hour 
Not for just a day 
Not for just a year but always 
Lonesome me 
Poor little lonesome me 
So near and yet so far 
From happiness 
How I pray 
We'll meet again someday 
To love and laugh 
THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC 
I was christened Jeanne 
at home I am called Jeannette 
How old are you 
Nineteen I think 
Can you say Our Father 
Who taught it to you 
My mother 
Say the Our Father 
You claim to be sent by God 
To save France 
that is why I was born 
So you believe that God hates the English 
except for those who are going to die here 
Did he have wings 
Did he wear a crown 
What did he wear 
Was he naked 
Did he have long hair 
Why should he have had it cut off 
Why do you dress as a man 
When I have accomplished God's will for me 
I shall again wear omen's clothes 
So it is God who has dictated how you dress 
What do you expect from God in return 
The salvation of my soul 
This is blasphemy 
This is a disgrace 
for me she is a saint 
Did God make you promises of any kind 
That has nothing to do with your trial 
I think I will let the judges decide that 
Shall we vote on it 
Well what has God promised you 
When 
I know neither the clay 
nor the hour 
Write a letter by my dictation 
I have great sympathy for you 
Would you recognise your King's signature 
I have a letter from him to you 
I cannot read 
To our clearly beloved Jeanne 
Will you now say the Our Father 
Did God promise that you would be released soon 
By means of a great victory 
Has God told you that you will go to Heaven 
So you are certain of being saved 
Are you already in a state of grace 
Well answer Are you in a state of grace 
If I am may God so keep me 
lfl am not may God bestow His grace upon me 
Monseigneur 
please allow me to go to Mass 
Jeanne you shall be allowed to go to Mass 
it is abominable 
it is a disgrace to God 
You are no daughter of God 
you are one of Satan's gang 
Let them prepare the torture 
In the torture chamber 
Look at your judges 
But the wisdom of God is even greater 
but from the Devil 
who has deceived you 
and betrayed you 
I think she is ready to sign the abjuration 
The Church is opening her arms to you 
alone 
Yes alone 
alone with God 
Even though you torture my soul out of my body 
I shall confess nothing 
and if I should confess 
She is very weak 
She has a fever we shall have to bleed her 
Go and fetch the Sacrament 
Is there anything you wish to say 
I am afraid that I am going to die 
and if I should die 
The Church is merciful 
I am a good Christian 
I love and honour God with all my heart 
You claim that I am sent by the Devil 
that is not true 
and you 
and you 
It is to you Jeanne I am talking 
it is to you I say that your King is a heretic 
My King is the noblest of all Christians 
The arrogance of this woman is incredible 
I have never clone anyone any harm 
If you do not sign you will be burned alive 
behold the executioner is awaiting you 
Sign Jeanne and save your life 
We have great sympathy for you 
Sign Jeanne 
In the name of the Lord Amen 
She has only made fools of you 
Long live Jeanne 
Go and fetch the judges 
I have forsaken God I have lied 
hurry 
I have been a wicked person 
I have denied God to save my life 
That was a fatal answer 
I have confessed only for fear of being burned 
Have you anything else to tell us 
We have come to prepare you for death 
Now already 
What kind of death 
At the stake 
I will go and fetch the Sacrament 
His ways are not our ways 
Yes 
I am His child 
And the great victory 
MV martyrdom 
And your release 
Death 
Do you wish to confess 
Heretic Relapsed Apostate idolatress 
unto life everlasting Amen 
Dear clear Jesus I accept my death willingly 
let my suffering be short 
will I be with you tonight in Paradise 
Jesus 
You have burned a saint

Go help yourself There's more over there 
It's too far 
I wonder when are we going back to the front 
Tomorrow 
It's enough to take away a man's appetite 
That's a good idea 
Let's do that 
How far is the dressing station 
About two miles 
We could take his things to him 
Good 
Everybody says it's somebody else 
Well how do they start a war 
Well one country offends another 
How could one country offend another 
Well stupid one people offends another 
Oh if that's it I shouldn't be here at all 
I don't feel offended 
It don't apply to tramps like you 
Good 
Then I can be going home right away 
Ah you just try it 
Yeah You wanna get shot 
The kaiser and me 
He's there already 
Somebody must have wanted it 
Maybe it was the English 
No I don't want to shoot any Englishmen 
I never saw one till I came up here 
No I'm sure they weren't asked about it 
No 
Well it must be doing somebody some good 
Not me and the kaiser 
I think maybe the kaiser wanted a war 
You leave us out of this 
I don't see that 
The kaiser's got everything he needs 
Well he never had a war before 
Why that's history 
Yeah generals too 
They need war 
And manufacturers 
They get rich 
I think it's more a kind of fever 
We didn't want it The English didn't want it 
And here we are fighting 
I'll tell you how it should all be done 
Whenever there's a big war comin' on 
you should rope off a big field 
And sell tickets 
The best country wins 
Don't forget 
We'll be back 
Give the boy my regards 
There he is 
Hello Kemmerick 
How's it going

They took it while I was under ether 
Franz you'll get it back 
Do you feel all right 
Just look at my hand 
That's because you lost so much blood 
Just eat decently and you'll get well again

There aren't 
Just look at those thin little shoes 
She couldn't march many miles in those 
Paul 
A thousand pardons 
How old do you think she is 
Oh about 22 
No that'd make her older than us 
She's 17 
A girl like that 
That'd be good eh Albert 
We could take a bath wash our clothes 
All right 
and I might even go so far as to get deloused 
Wait a minute 
She's a long way from here now 
Look at the date May 1917 
Four months ago 
That's true 
Well here's to her anyway 
Here's to 'em all everywhere

No Mother 
I got leave 
Here I am cryin' instead of being glad 
Anna get down the jar of blackberries 
You still like them don't you 
Yes Mother 
I haven't had any for a long time 
We might almost have known you were coming 
I'm making potato cakes 
Don't let them burn 
Paul sit down beside me 
My Paul 
My baby 
Look Mother Bread sausage and rice 
Paul you've been starving yourself Hmm mm 
Hadn't I better go and tell Father Paul's home 
Paul could watch the things on the stove 
No I'm getting up 
Oh Paul you're a soldier now aren't you 
But somehow I don't seem to know you 
I'll take these off Mother 
I'll get your suit 
It's in the wardrobe just where you left it 
Are you really here Paul 
You won't 
You won't disappear will you 
No 
I'm here 
Your things are ready for you Paul 
I remember when you caught that one 
Yes 
And you took it away from me didn't you 
Yes I did 
Gentlemen my son 
How are things out there 
Terrible eh 
Terrible 
But we must carry on 
Naturally it's worse here Naturally 
But the best for our soldiers all the time 
That's our motto 
The best for our soldiers 
But 
you must give the Frenchies a good licking 
And if you boys want to come home ehh 
Give us a hand there men 
Now then there's the line 
Here is St Quentin You can see for yourself 
You're almost through now All right 
And then you will have peace 
Oh You don't know anything about it 
You can't judge that 
But for that you receive the highest honor 
On to Paris 
Push on to Paris 
Right 
No not in Flanders 
I'll tell you just where the break should come 
Here 
The enemy has too many reserves there 
I insist upon Flanders 
Because Flanders is a flat country 
No mountains no obstructions 
There's too many rivers there 
From the farms they have gone; 
from the schools from the factories 
Paul 
How are you Paul 
Glad to see you Professor 
Look at him sturdy and bronze and clear eyed 
Oh lad you must speak to them 
No I can't tell them anything 
You must Paul 
Just a word 
Tell them why you went and what it meant to you 
I can't say anything 
Tell about it 
I can't tell you anything you don't know 
We live in the trenches out there 
We fight 
We try not to be killed; sometimes we are 
That's all 
No 
No Paul 
I've been there 
I know what it's like 
That's not what one dwells on Paul 
We used to think you knew 
The first bombardment taught us better 
It's dirty and painful to die for your country 
He tells you Go out and die 
Coward 
No 
No 
Boys boys 
I'm sorry Baumer but I must say 
It's no use talking like this 
You won't know what I mean 
I shouldn't have come on leave 
You can't fool anybody about that very long 
Three years we've had of it four years 
Every day a year and every night a century 
I'll go back tomorrow 
Sorry 
Must you go tomorrow Paul 
Must you 
Yes Mother Orders were changed 
Are you very much afraid Paul 
No Mother 
There's something I want to say to you Paul 
It's 
They're no good 
Where we are there aren't any women Mother 
Be very careful at the front Paul 
Yes Mother I will 
I'll pray for you every day 
Yes Mother I'll try and get in the cookhouse 
That can easily be done 
That won't worry me Mother 
They'll keep you nice and warm 
They're all wool 
That's sweet of you 
Good night 
my son 
Good night Mother 
Oh Mother Mother 
You still think I'm a child 
Why can't I put my head in your lap and cry 
Is this the 2nd Company 
Yes sir 
Is this all of it 
Yes sir 
How old are you 
No use I couldn't find anything 
We'll have to eat the sawdust 
Not me 
I'll go hungry first It makes me sick 
Now it's gonna be a real war again 
Paul 
How's old Paul 
Here I am 
I'm glad you found it 
I guess I don't get much of this 
No joke either Eats ya up inside 
This doesn't look much like the old 2nd Company 
All they know how to do is die 
I guess some of the old timers are here yet 
Where's Westhus 
Is it true about the armistice 
Doesn't look that way back there 
You mean they want us to go on fighting 
That's what they say 
They're crazy 
Germany'll be empty pretty soon 
Where is Where is Detering 
He got homesick 
You remember about the cherry blossoms 
I guess he never got over that 
Where's Kat 
Is he 
Not Kat 
If he were out the war would be over 
You remember what he always says: 
They're savin' him for the last 
Where is he 
Which way 
Down the road about two miles that way 
I'll see you later 
Kat 
Paul 
Hello Paul 
How's the side 
Oh it's all right now 
It's fine 
Have any luck 
Let's sit down there 
Tell me Paul 
how was it at home 
Have a good leave 
In spots 
What's the matter 
Ohh I'm no good for back there anymore Kat 
None of us are We've been in this too long 
The old men said Go on 
Push on to Paris 
It's not home back there anymore 
You're all I've got left Kat 
I'm not much to have left 
I missed you Paul 
At least we know what it's all about out here 
There're no lies here 
Push on to Paris 
They eat white bread over there 
What've we got left 
Guns so worn they drop shells on our own men 
No food no ammunition no officers 
Push on to Paris 
So that's the way they talk back there 
I guess we'd better be going 
How I lied to my poor mother 
Down 
Wait a minute 
Looks like the old bread wagon's broke down 
I guess I don't walk the rest of the way 
Did that get ya Kat 
Aah I think it broke my shin 
That's not so bad Hold it together 
Just my luck huh 
Good luck 
That means the war is over 
Oh no sir 
This war don't end till they really get me 
Aah Easy now 
Hey Easy

Ah we'll surely see each other again Kat 
And my first bombardment How I cried 
I was a young recruit then

He's dead 
Would you like to take his pay book 
You're not related are you

Guess so 
It's the first one I've heard ma'am 
I raise wheat to sell not to play with 
Every grain counts

Get to work Kate that fan's for the files 
If the files are as hot as I am they need it

It was my fault for putting 'em there 
Minnesota eh 
Swede 
Lonesome in the big city aint it 
What you doin' here 
I'm down here to sell our wheat crop 
I always do that at home 
It makesMa's work easier 
Living on a farm must be wonderful 
I'm certainly glad to have met you 
I'm glad too 
CROP ESTIMATE PUTS CORN PRICE UP WHEAT DOWN 
No letter from Lem yet 
I'm worried Mother 
You keep forgettin' our boy's a grown man now 
Hey How does he rate a private breeze 
How old is this fish anyway 
Don't ask me Mister 
Look in his mouth 
I sold the wheat today 
I hope Pop won't be mad 
He sent you to sell it didn't he 
But i didn't get his price 
I'd rather be deaf than blind wouldn't you 
I can see you'd be nice company 
What do you do with your evenings 
You'll never know 
You shouldn't 'a done that 
Fighting over me 
I'm going home 
on the one o'clock train 
Cut short the side order Kate 
the boss is givin' you the eagle eye 
There's something I wanted to ask 
I wanted to ask 
If you 
If you

Guess one place is good as another 
It's all a wash out If you ask me 
I think I'll wait a minute 
YOUR WEIGHT and YOUR FORTUNE 
I left something behind

Your Son 
The boy's been roped in 
And a man of my own a real two fisted guy 
Ma this is Kate 
This is the prettiest bridal bouquet I ever saw 
You're Marie ain't you 
Father here's Kate 
How much did you get for the wheat 
Didn't I tell you not to sell under $1 15 
Change your clothes and get to work 
The harvesters are comin' in the mornin' 
Don't mind Father 
he's upset 
And he never can bear to be crossed 
I want to talk to you 
What any other wife expects 
I married Lem because I 
I love him 
My son does what I say and so will you 
Your father hit me 
Kate 
I can't strike my own father 
And this is our honeymoon 
I got some surprise for you 
Lem's went an' married a city girl 
Good looker 
The old man's like a mad bull 
I'm gonna have first look 
Maybe I'll help the old man bust it up 
Well Pa in law where's the blushing' bride 
Get busy 
Do somethin' to earn your keep 
I don't think much of the company 
Don't waste any more time 
we got to get started 
Aw she don't weigh no 187 pounds 
I don't want anything to eat 
You said it 
Kate we can't go on like this 
Kate Let's forget this quarrel and be happy 
I love you you're my wife 
This aint the bridal suite 
You mind your own business 
that goes for all of you 
Hailstorm Sweeps Canada 
There's a hailstorm comin' 
We'll have to work all night to save the crop 
I cut my hand on the machine 
Say are you crazy 
What's the matter with you hicks 
Don't people ever fall in love out here 
I'll treat you right 
I always knew you wasn't a good woman 
What's the use of talkin' to that old devil 
I know how to get even with him 
The storm'll be here in no time 
But you're all alike cheap sports 
You all talk big when you want something 
You agreed to work all night 
We've changed our minds 
We're quitting' now 
Haven't you anything to say 
Not a thing you can believe it or not 
If I thought it was true 
Yeah 
What would you do 
Run to Papa 
You got to learn any man can get a wife 
I guess our marriage was a mistake 
I'll shoot the first man that leaves my farm 
Listen to me Kate 
I've settled your score with the old man 
Are you comin' 
Yes yes but I've got to have time to pack 
Here's somethin' Mac forgot

You're on the wrong road 
Let me give you a lift Kate 
When I got your note Kate I went crazy 
Father here's Kate 
Can you forgive me Kate 
Come back with us to your home 
Its tail comprises five prismatic joints 
Even a rat for all its fury falls prey to it 
Some hours later 
Stop it 
Perhaps I just happened to fall 
No 
We saw nothing 
Is there any news yes or no 
Yes the Majorcans are here 
Quick to arms 
To the rear

This document testifies to our faith in you 
Children women old men 
You scoundrel 
You are entirely to blame 
You compromised me too 
Do you realise that not one child survived 
Many women and old men perished too 
You're bothering me about a few brats 
Filthy ruffian you've dragged me down with you 
Dishonoured me 
You can die for all I care 
Then listen to my last words 
Has he gone 
Are you sleepy 
I was just falling asleep 
Where's the light switch 
At the foot of the bed 
Your elbow's hurting me 
Where's your hand 
That feels so good 
Let's just sit here and not move 
Are you cold 
No I was falling 
I've been waiting so long for him 
My love my love

May I present my daughter Mina 
Count Dracula 
Miss Weston 
How do you do 
And Mr Harker 
How do you do 
Count Dracula has just taken Carfax Abbey 
The abbey could be very attractive 
I shall do very little repairing 
The abbey always reminds me of that old toast: 
Nice little sentiment 
But there's more even nicer 
Oh never mind the rest dear 
Why Count Dracula 
There are far worse things 
Oh Lucy you're so romantic 
Laugh all you like I think he's fascinating 
Oh I suppose he's all right 
But give me someone a little more normal

Don't throw my spider away from me 
Oh Martin 
Oh 
Ain't you ashamed now 
Ain't you 
Spiders now is it 
Flies ain't good enough 
Flies 
Flies 
Poor puny things 
Who wants to eat flies 
You do ya loony 
Not when I can get nice fat spiders 
All right Have it your own way 
Gentlemen we are dealing with the undead 
Nosferatu 
Yes Nosferatu 
The undead 
The vampire 
The vampire attacks the throat 
The vampire is a pure myth superstition 
Nothing human 
As far as we know Doctor 
But you tell me that he escapes from his room 
He's gone for hours 
Thanks I'm feeling much better 
I am here to help you 
You understand that do you not 
Why of course And I'm very grateful 
Keep your filthy hands to yourself 
Now now Renfield 
Oh Dr Seward send me away from this place 
Send me far away 
Why are you so anxious to get away 
Yes 
Bad dreams  wolf howls   wolf howls 
He thinks they're wolves 
Me I've heard 'em howl at night before 
He thinks they're talking to him 
He 'owls and 'owls back at 'em 
He's crazy 
I might have known I might have known 
Now now Renfield 
We will get no more out of him now for a while 
Take him away Martin 
On your way old fly eater 
All right Martin 
Come along now Come along 
What was that herb that excited him so 
It is a plant that grows in central Europe 
Renfield reacted very violently to its scent 
Especially by night  sobs   wolf howls 
Master you've come back 
No master please 
Please don't ask me to do that 
Don't Not her 
Please 
Please don't master 
Don't please 
Please 
Oh don't 
I laid in bed for quite a while reading 
It came closer and closer 
Dear it was only a dream 
And then in the morning I felt so weak 
Allow me 
Oh Certainly Professor 
Think for a moment 
No 
The lips touched you 
Where 
Is there anything the matter with your throat 
Oh no But I 
Permit me 
No please 
Yes 
How long have you had those little marks 
Marks 
Please 
Mina why didn't you let us know 
Do not excite her 
When Miss Mina 
Since the morning after the dream 
What could have caused them 
maid  Count Dracula 
It's good to see you back again Doctor 
I heard you have just arrived 
Excuse me Count Dracula Professor Van Helsing 
even in the wilds of Transylvania 
I had a frightful dream a few nights ago 
Stories 
Yes 
I can imagine 
Why John 
I can quite understand Mr Harker's concern 
I'm afraid it's quite serious 
My dear I'm sure Count Dracula will excuse you 
Oh but really Father I'm feeling quite well 
You had better do as your father advises 
Very well 
Good night 
John 
Why yes Thank you 
I'm sorry Doctor my visit was so ill timed 
Not at all 
Anything I can do gladly 
Look 
Dr Seward my humble apology 
I dislike mirrors 
Van Helsing will explain 
Phew What on earth caused that 
Did you see the look on his face 
Like a wild animal 
Wild animal 
Like a madman 
What's that running across the lawn 
Looks like a huge dog 
Or a wolf 
A wolf 
He was afraid we might follow 
Follow 
What are you talking about 
Dracula 
Dracula is our vampire 
But surely Professor 
A vampire casts no reflection in the glass 
That is why Dracula smashed the mirror 
I'd expect one of the patients here to say 
It must have blood or it dies 
Its power lasts only from sunset to sunrise 
And that's impossible 
What are you doing there 
Come here 
Did you hear what we were saying 
Yes I heard something 
Enough 
Be guided by what he says 
It's your only hope 
It's her only hope 
I begged you to send me away but you wouldn't 
Now it's too late It's happened again 
Harker  What's happened 
Take her away before  squeaking 
No no master I wasn't going to say anything 
I told them nothing 
I'm loyal to you master 
What have you to do with Dracula 
Dracula 
I never even heard the name before 
Oh no 
God will not damn a lunatic's soul 
Mr Harker it's horrible 
Oh it's horrible Dr Seward 
Miss Mina 
Out there dead 
Out where 
Thank heaven she's alive Thank heaven for that 
Alive yes 
Oh it's horrible Van Helsing horrible 
Incredible 
Ghosts 
Vampires 
And then Miss Mina 
What could she know about the woman in white 
It's bad enough for her to read about it 
Please please Mr Harker 
I was downstairs on the terrace 
I started to speak to her 
And then I remembered she was dead 
The most horrible expression came over her face 
She looked like a hungry animal A wolf 
And then she turned and ran back into the dark 
Then you know the woman in white is 
Lucy 
No John You mustn't touch me 
And you mustn't kiss me ever again 
What are you trying to say 
You tell him 
You make him understand I can't 
Professor 
It's all over John 
Our love our life together 
Oh no 
No no don't look at me like that 
I love you John You 
But this horror 
He wills it 
Van Helsing  Miss Mina you must come indoors 
You must 
Do you know what you're doing to her Professor 
You're driving her crazy 
But John 
Mina please get your bags packed 
Quite 
You will be safe if Dracula returns 
Mina I'll be waiting for you in the library 
Oh John 
Father talk to him 
Please don't let him go 
Oh Briggs 
I understand 
Very well sir  wolf howls   thud 
Quite 
Harker  Well Dr Seward what about it 
Is Mina going with me or not 
Now John please please be patient 
Mr Harker please come here 
Well 
John I know you love her 
I know 
That will do no good 
Dracula has great strength eh Renfield 
Words words words 
What 
What again 
Yes sir At once sir 
Yes sir Right away sir 
Here the doctor's pet loony is loose again 
And he promised me things 
Not in words but by doing them 
Doing them 
By making them happen 
And then he parted it 
And I thought he seemed to be saying 
Rats rats rats 
Thousands millions of them 
All red blood 
What did he want you to do 
That which has already been done 
Strike me down dead Doctor 
He's got me going 
Dracula is in the house 
In the house 
Maybe you're right but I have me doubts 
Come along old fly eater 
Van Helsing 
You are too late 
My blood now flows through her veins 
If she dies by day 
But I shall see that she dies by night 
Come here 
Come here 
Your will is strong 
Van Helsing 
More wolfbane 
More effective than wolfbane Count 
The odour in the room from that horrible weed 
It's stifling 
I can't stand it 
But the professor gave orders 
Never mind the professor now 
What is it Briggs 
I don't know Mr Harker 
I felt strangely dizzy 
And I can't get her to go to bed 
Well let me see her Tell her I'm here 
John 
Oh John I'm so glad you're here 
What have they been doing to me dear 
Locking me in my room 
Oh and the horrible smell of that awful weed 
It's been like a nightmare 
What's been the matter 
Why are you looking at me like that 
Mina 
You're so like a changed girl 
Oh you look wonderful 
I'm so glad to see you like this 
I've been awfully worried about you 
Mr Harker you'd better bring Miss Mina inside 
That's all right Briggs now that I'm here 
Run along Briggs Don't worry 
John Look the fog's lifting 
See how plain you can see the stars 
Yes 
Millions of them 
I've never seen them so close 
Would you like me to get you a ha 
Why what's the matter 
Oh nothing Nothing at all 
Come Let's sit down 
Van Helsing 
What 
But Van Helsing 
Come Seward 
There's not a moment to be lost 
Oh but I love the fog 
I love nights with fog

Why it's the only time I feel really alive 
There's that bat again  bat squeaks 
Yes Shoo

You will what 
Why I didn't say anything 
Yes you did You said I will 
Oh no I didn't 
John 
Come sit down 
There must be some way some way to save her 
But why dear 
Well I don't know He may be right Mina 
Your eyes 
They look at me so strangely 
Mina

Prying eyes can't peer into my secret 
What can he mean 
What does he say then 
His words carried me right away 
Victor have you seen him 
Yes About three weeks ago 
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory 
If he should be ill Now don't worry 
Perhaps he can tell me more about all this

Good night Victor And thank you Thank you 
Good night And don't worry Promise

Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed 
You mean changed as a result of his work 
Yes His work 
His insane ambition to create life 
How How 
Please tell us everything whatever it is 
He found what he needed elsewhere Oh 
The bodies of animals 
You do not quite get what I mean 
First to destroy it then re create it 
There you have his mad dream 
Can we go to him 
You will not be very welcome 
What does that matter 
I must see him 
But if you wish it I will go 
Fritz Hello

What about his work 
Stuff and nonsense What about his wedding 
Come and sit down Doctor 
You must be patient 
Do you expect perfection at once 
Mark my words he will prove dangerous 
Dangerous 
Poor old Waldman 
Or to know what causes the trees to bud 
And what changes the darkness into light 
I wouldn't care if they did think I was crazy 
Wake up and look facts in the face 
Here we have a fiend whose brain 
Whose brain must be given time to develop 
It's a perfectly good brain Doctor 
Only evil can come of it 
I'm astonishingly sane Doctor 
Patience patience 
I believe in this monster as you call it 
And if you don't well you must leave me alone 
But think of Elizabeth Your father 
Elizabeth believes in me 
My father 
He never believes in anyone 
I've got to experiment further 
He's only a few days old remember 
So far he's been kept in complete darkness 
Wait till I bring him into the light 
Here he comes Let's turn out the light

My riot squads don't get a moment's peace

Your papers

You make me puke 
Shoddy work my friend

No one better from Berlin to San Francisco 
Can it 
Damn it 
I can't take this 
He was always right on time before 
Thank God 
Finally 
Morning 
Are you nuts 
Close those blinds 
Gentlemen I hereby open this meeting 
Very true 
This state of affairs must end 
Things must return to normal or we'll go under 
Our coffers will soon be depleted 
Our reputation is suffering as well 
The police seek the murderer in our fold 
He must be killed eliminated exterminated 
Without mercy or compassion 
I invite your views gentlemen 
We need informers 
The girls gotta work the cops more 
What if we We have our connections 
He's not even a real crook 
I'll tell you about public cooperation 
Just thinking of it makes me puke 
I beg your pardon Commissioner 
But ain't it the truth 
Very true 
I believe you're exaggerating a bit Lohmann 
It can't really be that bad can it 
But it is Commissioner 
I've got another idea There was this magician 
The reward is still far too little money 
None of this is anything new 
This is all leading nowhere 
These children vanish without a trace 
And when they're found 
And the perpetrator 
No we'll go broke by then 
What then 
We have to catch him ourselves 
Yes that's what we must do 
There is perhaps one other way 
Fine but how And who 
But who 
There are no such people 
Who could do that 
Who 
The beggars 
The organization of beggars 
Blood pudding's on the upswing 
God this cheese stinks so good 
Take that you sons of bitches 
Hey stop snoring 
You'll wake up the lice 
Two four six 
All right Now come the courtyards 
Yes from number 1 to 88

Hey Who pulled up the rope 
Hey who pulled up the rope 
Bunch of morons 
Hello there 
Hands up 
Come out of there 
This may surprise you Franz but I believe you 
Just a moment 
Cigarette 
Uh oh 
I don't understand Inspector 
A man you say 
I know nothing Nothing at all 
Of course 
There's just one thing I don't get: 
That ploy won't work with me Inspector 
Listen 
What can happen to me anyway 
Maybe a little property damage so what 
Nothing was pinched 
But something was pinched my friend 
What 
Something got pinched 
How much 
Tell me what you know and I'll do the same 
I already told you I know nothing 
Very well 
Give it some thought Franz 
Take him away 
Send the night watchman in 
Mr Damowatz 
Please sit down 
Now then you said in your statement 
Is that correct 
Yes Inspector 
Yes I'll swear to that anytime 
Good 
Go home now and recover from your ordeal 
Of course Inspector 
Good morning Inspector 
Tell me is Inspector Lohmann in the building 
He's talking to someone 
No it doesn't matter 
I'll come over myself 
What 
I see 
Hasn't come home yet eh 
Come in 
Come in 
Listen the whole block is surrounded 
If he decides to go home he has to run into us 
So just keep on waiting 
Damn it 
What do you want 
I wanted to ask a favor of you 
Dishwater again 
I wanted to ask you 
Read this first 
A statement 
Yeah 
An office building was broken into 
That's a respectable part of town 
Perhaps not that respectable after all 
Hell this is getting serious 
What the Did they mean to empty the brothel 
Incredible 
Unbelievable 
I'll be damned 
This is madness 
So they were after the savings bank 
Good God What could this mean 
I don't understand at all 
They didn't even touch it 
Must've been a bunch of real idiots 
I'll be damned 
Isn't that something 
Nothing stolen but a man was carried off 
God knows where they took him 
That's just great 
And Franz isn't talking 
He's afraid of course 
What if we could get at him from that angle 
Lohmann if you'd be willing to help me out 
Very clever I see the wheels turning 
Let's send for this Franz 
You're wanted for questioning 
What 
They sent four guys for me 
What's this about 
Move it 
Homicide squad 
Inspector Karl Lohmann 
What do you want with me 
What have I got to do with the homicide squad 
But why 
Why 
You boys did your work a little too well 
One of the watchmen 
Dead 
Accessory to murder 
Nasty business 
Inspector I've had enough 
I want no part of this 
I'll tell you everything I know 
Very sensible but unfortunately too late 
It can't be too late 
It can't be 
I'll tell you everything 
Well 
The child murderer 
What 
Who 
The child murderer Inspector 
Just a moment 
This had to happen to me 
Me of all people 
Come sit down my boy 
We're gonna level with each other got it 
Certainly Inspector 
And God help you if you pull something 
The one that went belly up in the Depression 
That's the one 
Get out here 
Let me go 
What have I done to you 
You swine 
Let go of me 
Bastards 
Swine What do you want from me 
What do you want 
Help 
Help 
Let me out of here 
I want out 
Let me out of here 
You'll never get out of here 
I beg you let me go 
This whole thing must be a mistake 
A mis 
No No mistake Out of the question 
No 
No mistake 
You recognize this 
Just like this one 
No 
But I never 
I never even met her 
You never even met her 
I suppose you never met her either 
Or her 
You never met her either 
Stop him 
Grab him 
Stop him 
Don't let him escape 
Watch out 
The door 
Let me out 
Punch him in the face 
Let go of me 
You have no right to treat me this way 
We'll show you we do 
You have no right to hold me here 
Right 
Right 
Kill him Kill the rabid dog 
Ice him Let him have it 
Quiet 
Kill him 
You spoke of right just now 
We will be your right 
They'll make sure you get your rights 
You'll even have defense counsel 
Everything according to the letter of the law 
Defense counsel 
You perhaps 
Hey you 
If I were you I wouldn't make big speeches 
And just who are you 
Though I'm afraid it won't do you much good 
Do you all want to kill me 
You want to just wipe me out 
We simply want to put you out of commission 
And we'll only be sure of that when you're dead 
But you can't murder me just like that 
I demand to be handed over to the police 
That's a good one 
No no more of that 
You must be taken out of action 
You must go 
But I can't help it 
I can't 
I really can't help it 
We know that one 
Before the judge we all can't help it 
What would you know 
What are you talking about 
Who are you anyway 
Who are you 
All of you 
Criminals 
Probably proud of it too 
But me 
Can I do anything about it 
Don't I have this cursed thing inside me 
This fire this voice this agony 
So you mean to say you have to kill 
It's me 
I'm shadowing myself 
Silently but I still hear it 
I want to run run away from myself 
But I can't 
I can't escape from myself 
I want off 
They never go away 
They're always there 
Always 
Always 
Except when I'm doing it 
When I 
Then I don't remember a thing 
I read and read 
I did that 
I don't remember a thing 
But who will believe me 
Who knows what it's like inside me 
Don't want to 
Must 
Don't want to Must 
Help 
I can't 
I can't 
In other words he must commit murder 
Right 
Such a man must be obliterated 
Wiped out 
May I address the court 
Counsel for the defense has the floor 
That's irrelevant here 
That's right 
Get outta here will you 
Are you nuts or plastered 
That he should live 
Will you guarantee his cure 
What does the state build asylums for 
What if he breaks out 
Or he's declared cured and released 
And one fine day the killing starts all over 
Another month long manhunt 
Another breakout or possible release 
And again must kill 
Is this supposed to go on indefinitely 
Not even the state and all of you least of all 
You never had kids did you 
Then you never lost any either 
Why don't you ask the mothers 
You should ask the mothers 
The woman's right 
No mercy for the killer 
Let him have it 
Slaughter the bastard 
Kill the monster 
Kill him 
Put the animal to death 
Kill him 
Waste him 
Get rid of him 
Annihilate the monster 
I will not let you shout me down 
I demand that this human being 
That's not a human being 
I demand that he be handed over to the police 
The police 
Of all the dumb 
In the name of the law 
In the name of the people 
This will not bring our children back 
One has to keep closer watch over the children

Where's that 
You better hope they do 
I didn't know that was your line Sergeant 
It wasn't but it's going to be 
Do you think he'll be wearing his medal 
Why of course he will 
Mom Jim 
It's good to have you back 
You're a little thinner Jim 
Your cooking will fix that up 
Clint Well you haven't changed a bit 
But Alice I wouldn't have known you 
She's grown up hasn't she 
She certainly has 
And you look different too 
I think it's the uniform I miss 
It made you look taller and more distinguished 
Mr Parker it's nice of you to be here 
You have a lot to thank Mr Parker for 
That's nothing 
I've saved your old job for you 
Well I have 
I'm so glad to have you back 
I guess we'd better go home don't you think 
All right I'll take this 
I'll see you later Jim Goodbye 
The old place hasn't changed a bit 
Well let's sit down and have a talk 
Tell us all about the war 
I won't live that long 
Sure What is it 
And why should I tell him that 
It's kind of hard to explain 
But you see the Army changes a fellow 
It kind of makes you think different 
I want to do something worthwhile 
Jim how can you talk like that 
He's tired Mother Excited 
You don't know what you are saying 
A soldier of peace instead of a soldier of war 
I don't want to be a soldier of anything 
You see Mom 
I want to get out 
You found another job 
A man's job 
Where you can accomplish things 
That sounds very nice 
We've moved things around quite a bit 
The job's just about the same 
I was looking for the nearest dugout 
You'll hear lots of those explosions 
They're building a new bridge over there 
Better get busy and file those bills of lading 
Yes sir 
I certainly intend to 
Checks in day after day late from lunch 
He'll come out of it but it worries me too 
Is that you Jim 
It's me Mom 
Maybe you could speak to him now 
Hello Clint You're quite a stranger here 
Had your supper 
No I'm not hungry 
Well anyway sit down I want to talk to you 
Jim Mr Parker's very disappointed in you 
You haven't shown him anything 
You know your duty is to your job 
I know it but I just can't help it 
Maybe you're not well dear 
It isn't that Mom I'm all right 
It's not the kind of work I want to do 
I said so when I came home It's too monotonous 
But you don't seem to realize 
I've been through hell 
I'm out of step with everybody 
What would you do son 
Where would you go 
If that's really in your heart 
I think you certainly should follow it 
I knew you'd understand 
Before we know it he'll be leaving us again 
That doesn't matter 
He's got to be happy He's got to find himself

We might make a getaway 
I don't think they'd miss us How about it 
Come on 
Well here we are 
Why talk about work 
That's what interests you isn't it 
You're lucky Why 
You can go where you want when you want 
Can't you

You're a strange moody person 
Are you applying for that job 
I might consider it You're hired 
When do I start 
You've started several hours ago 
Don't you see Marie 
I swear I will 
What's the use of arguing 
Can't you see that neither of us is happy 
I'm happy 
I'm taking no chances of letting you go 
Get that 
I'm no fool I'd be a sucker to let you go now 
But I'm in love with another woman 
That's just too bad 
Why don't you play the game square 
Square 
Be yourself 
You do and you'll serve out your time

You'll be sorry you said that 
Now listen 
It's about time you called it quits 
You filthy good for nothing convict 
A bluff 
You'll see 
You'll see Put that down

Thank you very much 
I feel highly complimented 
I'm sorry 
I'm afraid you'll have to excuse me 
I have a warrant for your arrest 
And we can quote you literally 
Certainly 
Everything I've said are facts 
I want this rotten chain gang system exposed 
Print it all 
Sure I'll write it Gladly 
Merely a technicality 
Does that mean that I'll have to serve 90 days 
Back on the chain gang 
No 
if you don't mind Certainly 
Can you trust them 
I don't see why not 
I'm giving myself up voluntarily 
I think it best darling 
Why they can't fail to pardon you 
And we'll be together Always 
Gentlemen I've decided to go back 
Voluntarily 
On your assurance of a pardon 
And you won't regret your decision 
Yes he did 
Your capture and return cost the state $350 
My fee will be $2 500 
This is for the state 
There's your check Thanks Allen 
I won't get my pardon then is there 
But I'll get my pardon 
They'll give you the pardon 
They might want you to work for about 60 days 
This is the guy that all that fuss was about 
And if he tries to escape this time shoot him 
Escape 
I'm supposed to be a trustee here 
And that goes for all of you Get me 
Now take him out of here Come on 
Go on Find yourself a bunk 
Go on down the line 
It's a long story 
Sit down make yourself at home 
If you can 
They didn't I came back 
He just got lonesome 
What's a pardon 
These boys up here ain't never heard that word 
Neither has the Prison Commission 
What'd you do to get sent up here Bomber 
I aimed at the rat's head but I missed 
They just wanna make it tough on me I guess 
But I'll get the pardon all right 
This is the last word 
You might say it's it 
Come on get to work down there 
The case of James Allen 
Is Mr Ramsey present 
Ready Your Honor 
Your Honor 
His first and only offence 
Crime must be punished 
Five minutes Allen 
They refused to pardon you 
They refused 
The state's promise didn't mean anything 
It was all lies 
To keep me here nine more years 
Why their crimes are worse than mine 
Worse than anybody here 
You don't have to stay here nine years 
It's only nine months Jim 
Nine months of this torture 
I won't do it 
I won't do it I tell you 
I'll get out of here 
Even if they kill me for it 
It's still better to be honorably free 
But you've been working night and day 
It didn't do any good 
All right 
I'll wait nine more months 
I'll be a model prisoner if it kills me 
Well 
They've suspended decision Indefinitely

Ivan does not speak any language 
He has the misfortune to be dumb 
Oh hello 
Are you the owner here 
Yes Welcome to my poor fortress 
Fortress 
It once was 
Built by the Portuguese centuries ago 
I am Count Zaroff 
My name's Robert Rainsford Glad to meet you 
Very glad 
Ivan is a Cossack 
Smile Ivan 
But how appalling 
Yes I'm afraid I am 
You're certain 
I'd have never left the spot if I hadn't been 
The swellest crowd on Earth 
my best friends 
Death is for others not for ourselves 
That is how most of my other guests have felt 
Your other guests 
You mean this has happened before 
It would seem that this island were cursed 
That's just what the captain said 
Only he thought it was uninhabited 
We Cossacks find our inspiration in solitude 
Well it's a break for me anyway 
My house is yours 
They look about the way I feel 
Yes 
Ivan will show you to your room 
Thank you 
You'll find a stiff drink there also 
Thanks a lot 
All pleasure is mine 
Come in 
Ready Rainsford 
All set 
I'm afraid we have finished dinner 
But I have ordered something for you 
Thanks I don't feel like eating though 
Oh 
Well perhaps later 
A Assume a cheerfulness you may not feel 
Why sure Of course 
Thank you 
Miss Eve Trowbridge 
How do you do 
How do you do 
And her brother Mr Martin Trowbridge 
How are you old chap 
Pretty well shaken up I guess huh 
Coming out of it now thanks 
We know how it feels don't we Eve 
Indeed we do 
Vodka that's the stuff 
Have to toss it off though Like this 
Same as Mr Rainsford 
Isn't that so Count Of course yes 
You were in a shipwreck too 
Yes 
Those channel lights must have been shifted 
I wonder it hasn't been reported 
Russians are not the best mechanics 
It's all right with me 
Just sketchily you know 
born married why I left my last job 
No no no no One moment please 
Wait a minute wait a minute 
Don't tell me 
Let me guess 
I know Flagpole sitter 
I know 
He wrote some books 
No he lived some books 
Yeah 
Here's to ya 
I've lugged a gun around a little 
I've lugged a gun around a little 
A papiroso 
Thank you 
Only in yours have I found a sane point of view 
What do you mean sane 
Cigarette 
Hmm Yeah Thanks 
You do not excuse what needs no excuse 
Let me see How did you put it 
You have put our case perfectly 
Then you're a hunter yourself 
We are kindred spirits It is my one passion 
He sleeps all day and hunts all night 
We'll have capital sport together I hope 
Don't encourage him 
But what do you hunt here 
I'll tell you You will be amused I know 
I have done a rare thing 
I have invented a new sensation 
Yeah and is he stingy with it 
What is this sensation Count 
Some He made kings some beggars 
Me He made a hunter 
Good for him 
My life has been one glorious hunt 
But when the revolution 
Look out 
Oh I'm so sorry 
I didn't realize the danger 
That must have been a close call 
Yes It still bothers me sometimes 
No no no No sport at all 
Well conditions are bad everywhere these days 
Hunting was beginning to bore me 
Is that such a terrible thought Count 
When I lost my love of hunting 
I lost my love of life 
of love 
Well you seem to have stood it pretty well 
Tartar which 
Tartar war bow 
That one up there 
It's cute 
A new animal 
Exactly so 
You found one 
Yes 
Here on my island 
I hunt the most dangerous game 
The most dangerous game You mean tigers 
Tigers 
No 
It's no use Rainsford 
He won't tell 
My one secret 
You know Rainsford he hasn't failed yet 
If he says a thing is good it is good 
anything you want 
He's a good host and a good scholar eh Count 
Yes yes 
You want me to go hunting 
You just say the word We're pals 
A completely civilized point of view 
I tell you what you do 
You come to my place in the Adirondacks see 
I think we'd better change the subject 
All right Change the subject 
Oh I know 
Play the piano huh 
If you wish 
Perhaps the count doesn't want to play 
There you go sis throwing cold water 
Leave me alone I know where the piano is 
I'm perfectly sober 
Charming simplicity 
Completely civilized did you say 
Hunt first the enemy then the woman 
That's the savages' idea everywhere 
It is the natural instinct 
What is woman 
Oh I don't know 
Oh I don't know 
You Americans 
One passion builds upon another 
Kill 
Then love 
Oh Martin 
Come on Count 
Now you show them 
What do you suggest 
Oh just a good tune 
Just a good tune see 
I see 
Oh his hunting dogs 
Keep your voice low and listen 
It isn't true about the launch needing repairs 
Yes 
Two maybe 
There were four of us a week ago 
The other two have disappeared 
What do you mean 
That iron door 
Yes 
Two nights later he took the other there 
Neither has been seen since 
Have you asked him about them 
He says they've gone hunting 
Oh be careful He's watching us 
Will you smile as if I'd said something funny 
Now look here 
You must be mistaken 
Not now 
Applaud 
Attaboy 
Attaboy 
Thank you 
What did I tell you 
Smacks a mean ivory eh Rainsford 
It was splendid Don't stop please 
My dear lady you are pleading for yourself 
I can see the drooping of those lovely eyes 
Excuse me 
Oh no my dear 
No 
Charming children 
There you hear that sis 
Well after that I guess 
I guess I'll have to go 
Good night Mr Rainsford 
Good night 
We'll be seeing each other at breakfast 
Good night 
Good night 
You must be feeling the need of sleep too 
Yes I am just about all in 
Then Ivan will show you to your room 
Oh Martin turn in early please 
Indeed I shall 
Well good night 
Good night sir 
Sleep well 
Oh uh well here's to long life 
A long life 
Tired 
Me 
You know I'm not 
You know Rainsford we two are just alike 
Up all night and sleep all day 
Well good night 
Well what are we gonna do huh 
What's the big idea 
Your trophy room 
I'm sure you will find it most interesting 
Say that's a great idea 
Ho ho 
Now we're pals 
No more secrets now huh 
We'll make a night of it 
I hope so Mr Trowbridge 
Just you and I pals 
We'll have fun together huh 
Precisely yes 
Fun together 
Please let me come in 
I'm sorry to disturb you but I'm frightened 
What was it 
Those dogs My brother 
I've just gone to his room He isn't there 
He's probably somewhere with the count 
That's just what I'm afraid of 
Count Zaroff is planning something 
about my brother and me 
Oh I don't know but we've got to find him 
Won't you help me 
Why of course I'll help you 
Where do you think he's gone 
Where did the others go 
The iron door 
I'll meet you downstairs in five minutes 
Thank you 
That's queer 
It's unlocked 
He's coming down 
Back here quick 
Where is my brother Where is my brother 
You killed him 
You killed my brother 
You 
Why you 
Come come my dear Rainsford 
I don't want to treat you like my other guests 
You and I we are hunters 
So that's your most dangerous game 
Yes 
You hunted him like an animal 
I know what you think but you are wrong 
You raving maniac 
Yes yes yes 
I'll take it off 
when we've finished 
I always bring them here before the hunt 
Where do you get these poor devils 
They do not always mark it 
You shifted them 
Precisely right 
To be shot down in cold blood 
Oh no no 
Suppose he refuses to be hunted 
Ivan is such an artist with these 
And when they win 
To date I have not lost 
You murdering rat 
I'm a hunter not an assassin 
Come Rainsford Say you will hunt with me 
Hunt men 
Say you will hunt with me 
No 
What do you think I am 
What do you mean 
I shall not wait for the next ship 
Four o'clock The sun is just rising 
Come Mr Rainsford Let us not waste time 
Ivan 
Your fangs and claws Mr Rainsford 
Bob 
Bob 
Ivan 
Bob 
Bob what are they going to do 
I'm going to be hunted 
Oh no No Miss Trowbridge 
Outdoor chess 
His brain against mine 
His good craft against mine 
And the prize 
The prize 
You may recall what I said last evening 
Suppose you lose 
If I do not 
What shall I say 
 
I'm going with you 
No He'll kill you too 
Not at all 
One does not kill a female animal 
If you lose I can easily recapture her alive 
All right I'll take her with me then 
We'll set him a trail he'll remember 
Don't lose your nerve 
We'll beat this thing 
The others didn't 
We will 
Come on 
Let's get going 
It seems as though we've come miles 
Come on 
Let's keep going 
Come on 
We'll soon be safe 
No wonder he was so sure 
This island is no bigger than a deer park 
Oh Bob 
Come on now 
What are we going to do 
Alone 
And leave you here with that savage 
Not a chance 
You'd never get near him He'd shoot on sight 
Weapons aren't everything in the jungle 
The one we just passed Yes 
I want to show you something 
You see 
A Malay deadfall 
What's that 
A man killing contraption the natives use 
It would stop that madman all right 
Trouble is it takes quite a few hours to build 
He said he wouldn't follow till midnight 
That's right 
If you help me I think we'll have time 
Come on We'll cut some strong vines 
There 
Almost ready 
He'll have been on his way almost an hour now 
Look out Don't touch that trip line 
You'll have a two ton tree down on your back 
Jungle wood's as heavy as iron 
Will it really work 
Look 
We're ready Let him come 
Give me that knife 
Come out Rainsford 
Why prolong it 
I'll not bungle this shot 
You'll never even feel it 
Oh very well 
If you choose to play the leopard 
I shall hunt you like a leopard 
Wait 
Maybe it's a trick 
Eve 
Why did he go 
He's playing with us 
like a cat with a mouse 
What do you mean 
That means he's gone for his high powered rifle 
His rifle 
Oh Bob we must get away from here 
Run quick 
Eve wait 
No I tell you no 
Don't stop No 
Wait 
That's Fog Hollow ahead 
Fog Hollow 
The swamp where he caught the others 
But there's no place else to run 
That's just what he's counting on 
We've got two hours till dawn 
We've got to use our brains instead of our legs 
But he'll have his rifle 
And we'll have a man trap 
Look 
It makes me dizzy 
Cover this over 
Quick 
Gather some leaves and grass 
I'll cut some branches 
Yes Very good Rainsford 
Very good 
You have not won yet 
Look at your watch 
Are you looking at it 
Still half an hour till sunrise 
You have made my rifle useless in the fog 
You cannot blame me if I overcome that obstacle 
Those animals I cornered 
now I know how they felt 
Achmed Miss Trowbridge bring her here 
Now 
My dear Rainsford I congratulate you 
You have beaten me 
Not yet 
Oh but of course 
I insist 
Why you're 
You're not even wounded 
You hit the dog not me 
I took a chance and went over with him 
I cheerfully admit defeat 
Here's the key of the boathouse 
The door is in the trophy room 
No 
Ohh 
Bob 
Eve 
The boat Quick 
Impossible 
Now look here That's a river Water 
Ganges 
Is that the Mutier escarpment 
What river is that 
I'm afraid you're wasting your time with him 
He's working himself into a juju 
All right Riano Take him away 
Very helpful I don't think 
Always the same old tales 
Mutier escarpment too strong too high 
Perhaps we haven't What 
Just how keen are you on this idea 
It means escape from this cursed hole 
I'm keen all right So am I 
Excuse me miss Can I help you 
I'm looking for my father 
I can't think why he isn't here I cabled him 
My name's Parker 
Jane Parker Excuse me

What a good chance we came down here 
Why this is Mr Holt your father's partner 
How do you do What marvelous luck 
How do you do He's still here my father 
He hasn't gone away or anything 
No he hasn't gone

How is my father

How much more so in death 
Have they gone 
Far enough 
One good turn deserves another 
He'll tell us now 
Come on get up 
He's dead 
Anyone would die who look at Mutier escarpment 
Poor fellow 
He died too soon Did he I wonder 
He was crazy with fear yet he managed to point 
And that's the direction in which he pointed 
And that's the Mutier escarpment eh 
Yeah and all we've got to do now is climb it 
Here 
Why Is this going to be dangerous

I've been reproaching myself all the time 
Reproaching yourself Why

What is it 
Were you very frightened 
At first 
I thought he was a savage 
Now I find out he wasn't That's all 
I can't make it out How did he get here 
What does it matter 
He's happy and 
At least he was until 
He's white

Go call somebody 
A funny looking kid's just moved in 
He's always getting into mischief 
Look at him He's got a face like a bug 
Upset tummy Please don't feed him anything 
Who made my brother cry 
Where did you move here from 
Azabu 
I'll give it to you good at school 
This is our new home 
You need to get along with the local kids 
MORNING 
You like your new school 
We like the walk there and the walk home 
But the part in between isn't much fun 
Aren't they coming to school 
School's already started 
He's mean 
It's early but let's eat lunch anyway 
I forgot my chopsticks 
How's life in the suburbs 
Very quiet Good for the children too 
Mr Iwasaki would like to see you 
Good for the children he says 
There's no grade on it 
Are you any good at writing 
Can you write an E just like the teacher does 
That worked well 
Sissies 
Too scared to come to school 
Say that again 
We'll save him for later 
The teacher 
I thought they were going to school every day 
Well I'm glad to hear he's not sick 
Your younger son's teacher was worried too 
I'll give them a good talking to 
What school did you go to today 
Where did you write that 
Why are you boys skipping school 
Don't you want to become somebody 
Yes but some bullies at school pick on us 
They can't if you just ignore them 
But they'll still beat us up 
THE NEXT MORNING 
Dad said to ignore them 
But if we do they'll beat us up for sure 
I wish they'd ignore us when we hit them 
May I use the bathroom 
It's a sparrow's egg 
Why did you bring it to school 
NOT TO BE OUTDONE 
If you eat it you can be as strong as him 
He ate it Now he'll be a great fighter 
You know why Mom's so happy 
It's payday for Dad 
I found a sparrow's nest 
I think my mom will buy some beer today 
Would you care for any beer today 
Bring half a dozen bottles please 
My lucky day 
You ought to turn it in to the police 
You want change 
Wait here We'll be right back 
Pick on those two again and you'll hear from me 
Tell him off too 
Who made my kid cry 
His father can look really scary 
That's nothing You should see what mine can do 
A caramel Dad 
Can your dads take their teeth out like my dad 
My dad's got lots of suits 
That's 'cause he's a tailor 
My dad's the most important 
That's my dad's car 
So my dad's more important than yours 
My dad's car is fancier 
That's 'cause it's a hearse 
It's not distemper 
Try giving him this 
Maybe you'd better take some too 
Why won't you lie down 
They're going to show home movies at his place 
I gave you a sparrow's egg so let me come 
No you can't come You didn't give me an egg 
THAT NIGHT 
I brought an egg Let me watch the movies 
You boys are here too 
It's like the lion on the toothpaste tube 
Which end does the toothpaste come out of 
The tail end 
Black stripes on white 
No white stripes on black 
If you're going to be so noisy go home 
You'd make a good comic actor 
It wasn't fair of you to take those 
Your father's funny 
You think Dad's an important man 
I guess so 
Stupid He's not 
Oh you boys are home already 
Why do you have to bow so much to Taro's father 
His father's a big executive in my company 
Why don't you become a big executive 
It isn't that easy I'm one of his employees 
He pays my salary 
Then don't let him pay you 
Yeah 
You pay him instead 
If he didn't pay me you couldn't go to school 
You couldn't eat 
Let's not eat anything starting tomorrow 
Because he has money 
Does money make him important 
Some people without money are important too 
Are you important 
Why are you pestering me with these questions 
See 
He's not 
I'm not afraid of you 
You're a weakling 
A yellowbelly 
Be good boys and stop your crying 
I'm stronger than Taro and I get better grades 
You got a spanking 
I give up 
I need a drink 
I know how they feel 
But what else could I have said 
Do you think they really understood 
I don't cozy up to the boss because I enjoy it 
Are you kidding 
I know that 
Will they lead the same sorry lives we have 
THE NEXT MORNING 
Hurry up before your father scolds you 
We're not eating 
We don't want anything 
Make them some rice balls 
I'm counting on you both to be big successes 
What are you going to be when you grow up 
A lieutenant general 
Why not a full general 
He says I can't That's what he's gonna be 
AND SO AS USUAL 
You better go say good morning to him Dad 
Who's got the best dad you or us 
You do 
No you do

LAND WITHOUT BREAD 
On the way to Las Hurdes we pass La Alberca 
It's a bit more prosperous but still feudal 
The church at La Alberca 
Most homes have three storeys 
Many homes have a religious text over the door: 
Ave Maria conceived without sin 
Why were they dressed so beautifully 
Newly wedded men gather 
Each must take up the head of a rooster 
A rope extends across the street 
On it hangs a rooster tied by the legs 
The men gallop by and try to catch a head 
It's a time for enjoyment 
In the crowd a baby adorned with silver medals 
They are like amulets from Africa or Oceania 
By 7 pm almost everyone is drunk 
They have a total population of ten thousand 
Just a few fruit trees rockroses and heather 
Inside are the scattered ruins of 18 hermitages 
Each is marked by a cypress or two 
Beyond here lies Las Hurdes proper 
We are entering the barren lands of Las Hurdes 
On its sloping streets we encounter daily life 
In summer water in scarce 
Strange things go on here 
Until recently bread was almost unheard of here 
The children are summoned to school 
They go there mainly to beg 
These hungry children are learning algebra 
Who could have made this absurd engraving 
Most of the villagers are ill 
It's a scene of devastating misery 
The principle disease here is goitre 
Look at this woman with her goitre: 
She's only 32 years old 
On an empty street we see a girl 
We ask the mayor what's wrong with her 
She must be sick 
He asks her to open her mouth 
Her gums and throat are inflamed 
Sadly there's nothing we can do for her 
Two days later we returned to the village 
What do the people of this sterile land eat 
The only meat is pork 
But only the wealthier families have a pig 
Olive trees grow in more fertile spots 
But the olives are usually eaten by insects 
Goat meat is only eaten when a goat dies 
The owners of the hives are from La Alberca 
In spring they take the hives to Castilla 
It was being attacked by bees 
And swarms of bees had descended on it 
An hour later it was dead 
The potatoes have run out 
The villagers eat unripe cherries 
It gives them dysentery 
This is when the exodus begins 
They were carrying only a blanket 
We came upon another group several days later 
First they choose a spot close to the riverbank 
Then they cut down the rockrose and heather 
Their tools are rudimentary: pickaxe and shovel 
These are the only tools they have 
The plough is almost unknown 
This usually takes several weeks 
There's no nitrogen and it turns sterile 
That's what this family is doing 
The way is hard and footwear is scarce 
They fill their sacks with the precious leaves 
But there are many snakes hereabouts 
The bite itself is hardly ever mortal 
People and animals alike sleep on the leaves 
they can be used as fertiliser 
A house in Fragosa 
A bed of leaves extends from the doorway 
Every home in Las Hurdes is like this 
A typical interior 
The utensils are primitive and few 
In summer the water courses run almost dry 
Almost everyone in Las Hurdes has malaria 
The adult anophelese is found in every home 
See how it rests perpendicular to the wall 
The outcome of an anophelese bite 
This man has a fever 
We encounter many sick people in the streets 
Balconies are rare in Las Hurdes 
Some are dangerous 
We found it very hard to film them 
The shortest person here is 28 years old 
An older cretin 
A child has just died 
The mother 
The women gather at the house of the deceased 
It's hard to transport a corpse 
Most villages don't have a cemetery 
We decided to follow 
It's a journey that can take hours 
Crossing a river with a corpse 
Each grave is indicated by a cross 
Or by a piece of wood 
This is in one of the poorest villages 
A better off home 
She announces deaths 
She rings a bell and stops to pray 
Everyone lives in a single room 
But this home is a little more comfortable 
There's even a bed 
In winter the Hurdanos sleep fully clothed 
The wear their clothes until they wear out 
This woman says: 
Or reciting an Ave Maria for someone's soul 
We left after two months in Las Hurdes

Bradford Meade 
Chairman Of E Meade Publishing Empire 
Passed Away At 10:14 P M This Evening 
Just A Few Minutes After His Fugitive Wife 
Claire Meade Was Dramatically Captured 
Outside His Room At St Gavan's Hospital 
Mrs Meade Has Been Missing 
Since Fleeing A Prison Transport Van 
Six Months Ago 
Is This Bradford Mea's Body 
You Look Like A Young Doctor 
Fresh Out Of Medical School 
You Must Have Some Loans 
I Have A Proposition You Might Be Interested In 
PASSING FANCY 
A geisha says she loves her client 
and he lies saying he'll come again 
It's a shame to miss the main attraction 
Story telling for a kid is stupid 
Look at the barber 
Forget your business old man 
That was the true love of Takao a geisha 
Men yearn for love Love is an emotional boat 
It's a wise remark 
I hate girl trouble 
I hate money trouble but welcome girl trouble 
Love is so elusive 
Trust me and get married just once 
You'll enjoy it 
Have the bill charged to me 
You must have been beautiful before 
And now 
I can't be frank when I owe you money 
Stop being curious old man 
Anywhere here I can stay 
Of course 
I have a child but no wife 
Mind your son 
Homeless when you're so young 
I was at a spinning mill until yesterday 
Fired 
No relatives 
That's an old trick huh 
Young men have no pity 
What are you going to do 
She can stay here Will that be any trouble 
If so I'll handle it 
Dad 
Your work 
Don't nag your father 
Always be filial to your parents 
Don't your teachers tell you that 
Did you know why a hand has five fingers 
With only four it wouldn't fit into a glove 
Very funny 
Thanks for last night 
I spoke to her and decided she'll work here 
I was drunk Did I force her on you 
She's very nice 
I'm a good judge of people 
Sorry but I choose only people I like 
Everyone is so kind to me 
You hear that 
How sweet 
What grade are you in 
My name's Tomio Kimur I'm in third grade 
With better manners he'd top his class 
Yes 
He's too good for a dumb father like you 
I'm not as dumb a father as they say 
Doesn't Tomio need lunch 
You'd be a dunce without lunch 
How can I go to grade school with kids 
He'd be the school's prize dunce 
I forgot to ask your name 
It's Harue 
What was that 
Harue 
She reminds me 
I mean Harue 
She looks exactly like her 
Who 
The woman who jilted you 
No not her 
Who 
That little slut 
Act your age 
Age doesn't matter 
I'll get an advance from him 
I want to buy a gift for her 
Don't ask too often 
If he refuses so what 
How stupid he is 
Where did you find the girl 
She's like my daughter 
You're one to protect your treasures 
How could you keep her 
Anyone who harms her dies You understand 
For whom does she powder her face 
Ah how very sweet 
It's a terrible waste 
Let's get going 
No not today 
I have a stomachache 
Drop the act 
No one appreciates your play 
I forgot it 
My safety charm 
I don't dare go anywhere without it 
May he get to the factory in a hurry 
My stomach hurts so I prayed for recovery 
I'd better be going now 
Where's the funeral 
You think I'm going to a funeral 
How ominous 
Not going to work 
I bought it for you 
Keep it a secret 
She gets jealous 
Do you like me 
You're so very kind to me uncle 
Don't call me uncle 
Do you prefer me to Jiro 
He sort of scares me 
But he's nice when you know him 
On second thoughts I'm even better 
This one really costs a lot 
But the world is highly complicated 
May I have this 
Do you like soldiers 
High ranking ones 
Let's go to Jiro's place 
It was messy so 
How kind you are 
Don't act so friendly huh 
No more photos of you in uniform 
She wants some 
You're shrewd 
You made the kid say sweet words 
My friend is at your shop 
Go back quickly 
You won't return evil for good will you 
He has a reputation too 
I'm not so mean a woman 
He's so kind to me that I regard him as my uncle 
Why not regard him as a husband 
You'll never be able to know the way I feel 
I'm afraid I don't have time for guessing games 
But now ever since the accident 
Come to the restaurant 
The madam hasn't seen you for a long time 
I don't want to be with that Harue 
I want to talk about her do you mind 
Talk I'm listening 
I'll come to your place later Wait for me 
You look quite modern recently 
It's the times 
Do I look twice as handsome as I used to 
Go somewhere and play 
I'm busy studying now 
Don't interrupt me 
Just go out and play will you 
It's a kind of filialness 
Waiting is torture 
There was no need for a gift We can be informal 
Actually it's about Harue 
For that reason I must think about her age 
It's a pity to leave a girl her age alone 
With grown men like Jiro around 
I'd be pleased if Jiro decided to marry her 
Did he make love to her 
I don't know But be keeps away from her 
She's too good for him 
It's natural 
I was wrong 
She's too young for me 
Did you fancy her as your wife 
Things like that can happen 
It's so hot 
You have my trust Please try 
Whatever you may think I'm picky about my woman 
Oh Frankly she's too good for you 
Then you marry her 
It's good luck to be loved by a young girl 
I must have let down my guard with her 
You sure are stubborn 
But then so am I 
I'll match you that's for sure 
Why brood 
Why not tell a story 
Young man 
You call me young 
Do I really look so young 
Don't flatter me 
I've got news 
This boy's dad is stupid 
No he's not 
He can't even read can he 
He just looks at cartoons 
He doesn't go to the factory Only to restaurants 
Who did it 
I did Me 
I always tell the truth 
George Washington cut down a cherry tree 
You cheat by saying what I don't know 
Even the truth can't make you a magician 
You can't re create the tree 
What a dumb 
You don't work you're always drunk 
You trying to lecture your dad 
Drunk or sober I'm still your dad 
You're so dumb 
You can't even read huh 
Son 
Forgive me son 
Something is wrong with me 
I'm a dumb old dad but don't hate me 
Then the following morning 
That matter how is it 
Don't be so hasty Just leave it to me 
Behave yourself at school and be attentive 
Be patient and study and you'll get an education 
I'm patient and go to the factory So it pays me 
50 sen 
Buy whatever you want 
How funny 
You can't live as a pauper's son 
Examine it well It's milled 
You can polish your nails 
Very funny 
How extravagant today 
I haven't taken care of him properly 
I want to act like a good father 
50 sen is a lot to a boy his age 
Not ten You mean a thousand 
About Jiro 
It's time you accept Jiro 
It's time you quit nagging me 
You're to go home Your son is ill 
My son can't possibly be ill 
But he could get hurt 
Why did you get sick so suddenly 
He ate his fill in one go 
You spent it all 
It's difficult for a poor man's kid 
You did it You gave him too much 
Nurse him carefully 
A mere stomachache 
Have a drink and go to sleep 
This wine is very mellow 
I was worried I left work early 
It's serious So do something 
Don't shock me 
He's my son He can't die so easily 
Have a doctor examine him 
Get ready old man 
Then 48 hours later 
We'll try our best 
This charm is very effective 
It's terrible 
We may have to hold a funeral 
I'm glad I have formal summer wear 
Don't tempt Fate 
Don't worry 
Your son won't die 
You say that because he's not your son 
I'm sorry but I have to go now 
I'll leave Harue 
If she can help just ask her 
Your son's teacher is here 
I can't talk to a teacher 
Will you greet him for me 
You must be very worried 
You have the ball game 
We beat Class Three's team 
What's the problem 
50 sen's worth of candy all at once 
I guess it was all my fault huh 
I gave him cold wine too 
Not only that he ate bananas 
What's his illness called 
An acute intestinal catarrh 
Be a good boy and get well 
Hear what he said 
He's very kind 
So now you must get well 
I have only you 
So don't die before I do 
Do you know why a hand has five fingers 
I'll never forget that one 
Can't even make 5 yen 
It's a shame to be uneducated 
I made my son ill and can't pay the bill 
I have a bad habit of spending every penny 
Don't do that old man 
The doctor wants to talk to you 
What's the big problem 
How can I pay the hospital 
How much money do you need 
Maybe forty or fifty yen 
I'll raise the money 
I'm sure I can 
Now is the time I can repay your kindness 
What a wonderful girl 
Such a young girl trying to save a man 
Hearing your works I could even lose Tomio 
He would gladly die too 
I'll bring the money soon 
Don't be so proud 
I may be poor but I won't depend on you 
Hurry up and go to the hospital 
I want to talk with her for a while 
Stay put in your place 
Do you think you can shame the two of us 
But this is my chance to pay back his kindness 
Who cares what happens to me 
Who cares about me 
I'll raise the money 
Haven't you any idea how I feel 
Don't say anything 
Just obey me 
I know a place where I can get money 
Why do you need so much money 
I can't tell you 
Just lend it to me 
We're old friends 
I know you'll pay me back but 
When will you repay me 
Hokkaido Needs Men 
After I get to Hokkaido 
I was only kidding 
Thanks to warm hearted people 
Know why sea water is salty 
To salt salmon with 
Very funny 
Give me another fifty sen and try 
Don't pester people You should've died 
Wanted to eat funeral cake did you 
You told me a lie 
This water is salty but there's no salmon Why 
Suddenly Jiro is going to repay me 
All this brat does is cause trouble 
It's not goodbye forever Don't cry 
When you finally understand me we must part 
I don't think I'll ever be happy 
Don't be pessimistic 
Be patient for a while 
I'm going willingly 
I hate sad farewells 
I'll come back I promise 
Are you going to Hokkaido 
Let me go to Hokkaido 
You have Tomio old man 
Kids don't need parents 
Tomio will flourish without care 
You have a great future Jiro 
People will be relying on you 
I leave at ten Don't stop me 
I didn't mean to 
Don't hate me 
I'm going there 
Take care of Tomio 
Your sincerity moves me It's enough 
Accept his kindness You can work and repay him 
We must help one another 
The barber talks like a saint 
Remember to obey your teachers at school 
Don't eat too much candy 
Will you be back 
What a silly question 
I'm taking a vacation 
Know why a hand has five fingers 
If we had only four it wouldn't fit a glove 
What's that land 
America 
We've just left the port 
My son is a bright boy at school 
With better manners he'd be top 
No 
No 
Won't this boat stop 
Is that land linked with Tokyo 
Of course it is 
I'm sorry but I'll go home 
Why is sea water salty 
To salt salmon with 
Very funny 
Say is this the moving picture ship 
The Venture 
Yeah 
Carl Denham Guess that's the name 
He ain't scared of nothing 
Why all this talk about this voyage being crazy 
Not enough men to handle her Not enough 
Three times more than the ship needs 
Hey down there 
What do you want 
Denham aboard Who are you 
My name is Weston the theatrical agent 
Well why didn't you say so 
Come on aboard Denham's getting wild 
I hope you've got some good news for him 
Marshal will be aboard tomorrow or next day 
Trust me to see you through a blow 
Oh now don't get sore skipper 
Months wasted money gone and nothing to show 
Weston I was just going ashore to call you 
If I'd known that I would have waited 
I guess you met Driscoll the first mate 
Well Weston how about the girl 
It can't be done Denham What 
It's got to be done Now look here Weston 
Now all the agents in town have shut down on me 
All but you 
Then you're so secretive 
You said it 
There you are I've got a conscience Denham 
What is she to expect 
I mean the crew 
They look well enough 
Sure we're healthy 
I suppose there's no danger in New York 
Yeah but they know that kind of danger 
You never had a woman in any of your pictures 
Why do you want one Holy mackerel 
Do you think I wanna haul a woman around 
Then why 
Sure everybody likes romance 
Don't know where you'll get her 
We've gotta be gone by daylight 
Well there's a good reason 
I'm glad I didn't get you a girl 
You are eh Well I'll show you 
Something that nobody's ever seen or heard of 
Stand aside please 
Get your case later 
Say lay off the shoving will you 
Oh I didn't mean to shove you 
I catch you you stealer 
Now I get you cop You like that huh No no 
Let me go I wanted to but I didn't

Three people this week 
Here Here's a buck 
Hey taxi 
Feeling better 
Yes thank you 
You're very kind 
Don't you fool yourself 
How'd you ever get into this fix 
Bad luck I guess 
There are a lot of girls like me 
Not many with your looks 
I can get by in good clothes all right 
But when a girl gets too shabby 
Supposed to have an uncle someplace 
Did you ever do any acting 
The studio's closed now 
What's your name 
Ann Darrow 
I've got a job for you 
Costumes on the ship will fit you 
Come on 
But But what is it 
It's money and adventure and fame 
It's the thrill of a lifetime 
No wait I don't understand 
You must tell me 
I do want the job so but I can't 
Oh I see No you've got me wrong 
I only wanted 
Listen I'm Carl Denham 
Ever heard of me Yes yes

Hurry this line forward 
Forward you farmer and up here 
What are you doing up here 
I just wanted to see 
Oh you just wanted to see Well I'm sorry 
Make that line fast

No they're a nuisance 
I'll try not to be 
You've been in the way already 
Bring that ladder aboard 
Well you better stay below 
What The whole voyage 
I'm afraid I didn't apologize for hitting you 
Well we're off 
Too many 
Someday me go back China 
Charlie isn't the ocean wonderful 
I'd like to be 
Hello Ann 
Hello Jack 
Where you been all morning 
Trying on costumes for Mr Denham 
Both sides look all right to me 
Yes but you're not the movie director 
If I was you wouldn't be here 
Well is that a nice thing to say 
I haven't 
Sure you have 
Sure you have I don't see 
Well how Just 
Oh you're all right 
But women just can't help being a bother 
Made that way I guess 
That's 
Say 
I'd hate to have him hear me say that 
Don't you Iggy 
That's right 
Of course you do 
Put on one of the costumes 
I won't be a minute Beauty and the beast 
Mr Denham I'm gonna do some butting in 
What's your trouble 
When do we find out where we're going 
Pretty soon 
Will you tell us what happens after 
How can I 
I'm not a fortuneteller 
You must have some idea what you're after 
What's the matter 
You going soft Oh you know I'm not 
Not for myself 
For Ann 
Better cut it out Jack 
Love affair 
Think I'm gonna fall for any dame 
I never knew it to fail 
Who's going sappy 
I haven't run out on you No 
I'm going right into a theme song here 
Say what are you talking about 
It's the idea of my picture 
He says we've reached the position 
Good Come on Jack You're in on this 
There's our noon position 
Way west of Sumatra 
And way out of any waters I know 
Where do we go from here 
Southwest 
Keep your shirt on skipper 
Well that position 
He must have been kidding 
When the bark picked them there was one alive 
Where did you get it 
Singapore two years ago 
Skipper knew I'd be interested 
Does he believe it I don't know 
There's a long sandy peninsula 
A wall Built long ago 
The natives keep that wall in repair 
They need it 
Something they fear A hostile tribe 
Did you ever hear of Kong 
Why yes 
Some native superstition isn't it 
A god or a spirit or something 
Well every legend has a basis of truth 
And you expect to photograph it 
If it's there you bet I'll photograph it 
It's the prettiest 
All right Just stand right over there 
You don't have to worry about that 
What will I do 
Well we start with the profile 
You see me You smile a little then you listen 
Then you laugh 
All right Camera 
Looks kind of silly don't it 
Do you always take the pictures yourself 
Ever since a trip I made to Africa 
The darned fool I was right there with a rifle 
I haven't fooled with a cameramen since 
I do it myself Think he's crazy skipper 
Just enthusiastic 
Ann in this one you're looking down 
When I start to crank you look up slowly 
Then you just follow my directions 
Camera Look up slowly Ann 
That's it You don't see anything 
Now look higher still higher 
Now you see it You're amazed 
You can't believe it Your eyes open wider 
It's horrible Ann but you can't look away 
There's no chance for you Ann no escape 
You're helpless Ann helpless 
Try to scream Ann try 
Perhaps if you didn't see it you could scream 
What's he think she's really gonna see 
We should be near the island 
We've quartered these parts 
Can't see your hand in front of your face 
No bottom at 30 
How will we know it's the right island 
The mountain that looks like a skull 
Oh yes I'd forgotten You told me 
Skull Mountain 
By the deep 20 
Shallowing fast Mr Briggs dead slow 
Dead slow sir 
Confound this fog 
By the deep 16 
What'd she draw skipper 
Four 
Why don't he heave to until it clears 
Listen you hear anything 
No 
Breakers ahead 
Let go 
That's not breakers That's drums 
Not a living thing 
Funny they haven't spotted us 
Listen 
Maybe they have spotted us and are signaling 
Well skipper do you believe me now 
There it is 
Skull Mountain the wall 
Everything just like on my funny little map 
Come on 
Let's get started 
Have you got a good man with those gas bombs 
I think you better go along 
You may be able to talk to these birds 
All right 
Mr Adams Aye sir 
You'll take charge of the ship 
You bet 
Wait a minute Who's running this show 
You never can tell when you'll want them 
But you're crazy to risk 
And Jack don't forget the costume box 
Come on Ann 
All right boys let's go 
Take it easy with that camera 
Okay Plenty of ammunition for those guns 
Yes sir 
Be careful with those bombs 
Stand by to lower away 
You with the camera stick close 
Okay 
Who's got the bombs 
I have sir 
Watch your step 
Aye aye sir 
What queer looking boats 
Yeah outrigger canoes 
All attended to sir 
Good 
We all ready then 
Come on 
Not a soul in sight 
The people must all be gathered up ahead 
That wall skipper What do you think of that 
Colossal 
It might almost be Egyptian 
But what's on the other side of that wall 
I wanna know 
Who do you suppose could have built it 
Oh I was up on Angkor once 
Oh boy what a chance What a picture 
Come on 
Hear that 
They're saying Kong Kong 
Hope you talk their lingo skipper 
You catch any words yet 
I'm not sure 
What do you suppose is happening 
They're up to some of their heathen tricks 
But don't go rushing out to sea 
All right But isn't it exciting 
Sure 
I wish we'd left you on the ship 
Oh I'm so glad you didn't 
Wait Easy now Wait till I see what goes on 
Holy mackerel What a show 
Hey skipper come here and get a load of this 
Hey you with the camera Come here

Too late They see us

No use trying to hide now 
Everybody come out in plain sight 
Say let's scram out of here 
Stand still you fool 
Steady boys bluff them 
Come on skipper Make him a friendly speech 
He understands you skipper What's he say 
He's telling us to get out 
Well talk him out of it 
Ask him what goes on 
Find out what they're gonna do 
What's that 
He must be the witch doctor 
Steady with those rifles boys 
What's that 
He says look at the golden woman Yeah 
Blonds are scarce around here 
A gift for Kong he says Good Lord 
Wants to buy her 
He's offering to trade six of his women for Ann 
You got her into this Denham 
I'm gonna take her back to the ship 
Smile Ann and talk to Jack 
Keep your chin up 
Well I was a little scared 
I guess you weren't the only one 
I wonder what we do next 
That's just what's worrying me 
Don't talk like that 
I'd say he's crazy enough to try anything 
Well I won't go back on him 
Don't laugh I'm scared for you 
I'm sort of 
Well I'm scared of you too 
Ann

Like an old coat that is tattered and torn 
Left in this wide world to weep and to mourn 
Betrayed by a maid in her teens 
This maid that I loved she was handsome 
And I tried all I knew how to please 
As the man on the flying trapeze 
The daring young man on the flying trapeze 
And my love he has stolen away 
I know the second verse there 
His eyes would undress every girl in the house 
Now he smiles from the bar on the people below 
And one night he smiled on my love 
She blew him a kiss 
Do you mind if I take the third one 
I wept and I whimpered I simpered for weeks 
Alas Alack and Alaska 
I went to this fellow the villain and I said 
I'll see that you get your deserts 
His thumb to his nose he put up with a sneer 
He sneered once again and said no 
That daring young man on the flying trapeze 
My love he has stolen away 
The daring young

Great stunt King is going to pull

Personally I think it's silly too 
You look lovely child 
Are you pleased with the gown 
Ellie 
The gown 
Yes it's nice isn't it 
What's the matter child 
What's wrong 
Nothing 
No 
Because if you have it isn't too late 
You know how I feel about him 
You know the old pump isn't what it used to be 
What's the matter child 
Aren't you happy 
I thought so 
I knew there was something on your mind 
There now 
What's the matter 
Have you 
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby 
This must be serious 
Where'd you meet him 
On the road 
Oh no 
Who is he 
I don't know very much about him 
Except that I love him 
No it's no use 
He despises me 
Come now 
Yes he does He despises everything about me 
Ridiculous 
He doesn't think so much of you either 
Well I 
He says you raised me stupidly 
And now that's a fine man to fall in love with 
He's marvellous 
What are we going to do about it 
Where is he 
I don't know 
I'd like to have a talk with him 
No I'll go through with it 
No it doesn't matter 
I don't want to stir up any more trouble 
I've done it all my life 
I've made your life miserable And mine too 
I've got to settle down 
It doesn't matter how where or with whom 
You've changed Ellie 
Anyway what difference does it make 
I'll never see Peter again 
Is that his name 
Peter Warne 
Peter Warne 
Why do you know him 
Why no 
Father you haven't heard from him have you 
Don't be silly of course 
Please what's that 
The reward 
I'm sorry you read it 
Are you going to see him I suppose so 
Certainly 
Pay him off 
He's entitled to it He did an excellent job 
Thank you Mary That's just what I needed 
Mr Westley's on his way up

About your helping her 
Why did she think I lugged her from Miami

Isn't that sweet of her 
You don't I suppose

I'll have to see on what you base your claim 
I presume you feel justified 
If I didn't I wouldn't be here 
I got it all itemised 
Cash outlay $8 60 
Top coat $15 
Suitcase $7 50 Hat $4 
Three shirts $4 50 
Total $39 60 
Yes I know 
What's the matter 
Isn't it cheap enough 
Trip like that'd cost you a $1 000 maybe more 
Now let me get this straight 
You want $39 60 in addition to the $10 000 
What 10 000 
The reward 
Who said anything about a reward 
I'm afraid I'm a little bit confused 
I assumed All I want is $39 60 
It gives me the jitters 
The average man would go after the reward 
Did anybody ever make a sucker out of you 
Were you taken for a buggy ride 
Yes 
With all the trimmings 
So how about the check do I get it 
Certainly Thanks 
Here you are 
Thank you 
Do you mind if I ask you a question frankly 
Do you love my daughter 
Now that's an evasion 
The pill of the century 
Do you love her 
She's my idea of nothing 
Now don't hold that against me 
I'm a little screwy myself 
Here's to the merry go round 
Perfect 
Now you look natural 
I hope you got your money You bet I did 
Congratulations Thanks 
Same to you 
I would but I've got a weak stomach 
Now just a minute Ellie 
I don't want to hear another word about him 
Come on folks 
King Westley has arrived 
Here they come boys 
Turn them over 
You're a sucker to go through with this 
That guy Warne is okay 
You took him for a ride 
He loves you Ellie 
He told me so 
I can buy him off for a pot of gold 
And you can make an old man happy 
And you won't do so bad for yourself 
I will 
Ellen 
Ellie 
What happened 
I haven't the slightest idea 
Don't want to see anybody 
But it's King Westley on the phone 
That's satisfactory isn't it 
It ought to be 
I'm not complaining

I am 
I've lost everything 
Anyhow as long as I get it 
But when I do 
You had to go broke to get me there 
Quite a place you have here 
How do you do sir 
This is Beamish 
He runs the store 
How do you do 
Welcome Mr Arlington 
Thank you 
I fancied you could use one 
I could use three baths 
Well well 
Fresh from the Folies Bergère 
That's enough water 
A ceremonial dance 
Something to do with fertility 
Personal or agricultural 
Both I think 
Everything 
And a few extras 
I suppose you thought I was crazy 
It's a bit fantastic isn't it 
with a glorified native ape man 
Tarzan's as white as we are 
She's Parker's daughter 
She stayed behind when he died up there 
She's hit you pretty hard hasn't she 
I'm in love with her if that's what you mean 
Where shall I put these things 
Over by the table 
Go on over there 
Put it down easy now 
Come on now 
Charm her back to civilization 
Might remind her 
She's been up there nearly a year now 
Look here Harry 
I've got everything I have in this 
Ivory 
But if I can get the girl 
Well if that's the way 
I'll get it for you sir Just a moment 
Thanks 
No harm intended sir 
How much ivory is there really up there 
More than the largest safari can carry back 
Fortunate one for us though 
I made a map of it on the way back 
14 day trek you say 
With luck to the foot of the Mutia Escarpment 
What's that 
The Mutia Escarpment I mean 
Natives hold it sacred 
Taboo 
Deadly 
What about our safari 
How will they feel 
They're mostly village boys 
They'll be frightened 
But I got one safari across 
How many did you get back 
Myself 
Yes indeed 
Yes Saidi 
Need safari boy bwana Make new pick 
What are you saying 
We have 50 first class boys 
Fifty boy mulu bwana 
Gone 
Pierce and Van Ness 
What's the matter 
The map 
Beamish 
Coming sir 
They looked like slippery customers 
That they were 
Were Pierce and Van Ness in here again 
Only for a moment sir 
Saidi send out the runners drum up the tribes 
Get 300 boys 
How long ago did they leave 
Sun here bwana 
Three four hours 
How soon can we get started Harry 
With equipment six hours 
They'll have 10 hours' start 
Let's go without safari 
We'd be outnumbered and wouldn't have a chance 
Suppose we don't catch them 
What happens then 
I think I can find the barrier again 
But above that Tarzan is our only hope 
Come on Saidi keep them going 
Yes bwana 
Saidi 
Yes bwana 
Give me a hand here 
Here we go boy 
Take him over here 
Take that box 
Tell the boys to take a rest 
What's the trouble 
Bearers are done in 
I thought we'd better give them a breather here 
Yes bwana 
How many men have we lost 
Eight 
We figured 10 for the whole trek 
We didn't figure this pace 
Look at the condition they're in 
What is it 
A white man's campfire 
Pierce and Van Ness 
He says it's still warm 
Still warm 
Come on let's have a look 
All right 
Go ahead 
My gun 
No 
If they're close they'll hear us 
Easy Martin 
How old do you think it is 
Take cover 
Pierce and Van Ness 
Couldn't be anyone else 
Notice the delayed sound 
About 500 yards off I'd say 
Shall we have it out 
We'd better not 
The base of the Escarpment's clearer 
Rather meet them there 
All right 
You know the country better than I do 
We'll parallel their trail 
Right 
No use in walking into an ambush 
All right boys come on 
Yes bwana 
I don't like the sound of that chant 
I've hated it for days 
This is different 
They're frightened about something 
What's with them 
What's the matter Saidi 
Mutia 
What 
It is the Mutia 
It isn't any too soon to suit me 
And a day ahead of schedule 
We can't lose time just because they're afraid 
Come on Saidi get them going 
Yes bwana 
Boys get on your feet 
There's nothing to be frightened of 
What's the matter with him 
He afraid of Mutia 
Not go bwana 
Get into line 
Drop that spear and get into line 
No 
Anybody else that doesn't want to go 
Saidi take the lead 
I'll stay back here 
Yes bwana 
Whip would have done just as well 
Perhaps you're right 
He could have carried 150 pounds of ivory 
What's the matter Saidi 
Van Ness safari boy bwana 
Gaboni kill 
Gaboni 
Yes bwana 
Gaboni all time arrow here 
Couldn't be Gabonis 
They wouldn't leave the body here 
Why not 
They're cannibals 
First make kill 
Bye embark come back 
The wound looks pretty fresh 
They can't be far away 
The map 
Pierce must have it 
I wonder if he got 
Is this it 
The part we don't need 
Sacred ground 
What's that 
Drum 
Gaboni bwana 
It's pretty close 
We'd better make a run for it 
Right 
Come on Saidi get them going 
Make a stand 
No that's what Pierce and Van Ness did 
All right come on 
Bwana Mutia 
The Escarpment 
Come on 
Here they come 
They'll never follow 
The Mutia is sacred 
He was on the Mutia 
Lucky superstition for us 
We're out of range now 
What about a breather here 
We've got to make the top before dark 
Come on 
Keep them going Saidi 
Yes bwana 
What's the trouble Saidi 
Too hard bwana 
Yes bwana 
I hope we've got the worst behind us 
We have 
Saidi send the men for cover 
That's Tarzan 
He's calling them off 
Come along 
No use in starting a riot Martin 
Kill one and we'll have to kill all 
Am I glad to see you 
You got here just in time 
That's it Harry 
I told you I'd come back 
Come back 
How's Jane 
Man 
Yes Tarzan 
This is Martin my friend 
Martin my friend 
Harry Martin my friend 
Tarzan 
That's right 
But where is Jane 
Where is she 
How is she 
How are you 
Very well 
Thank you 
Has anything happened to her 
Much man 
Yes Tarzan that's our safari 
But 
There she is now 
Cheetah 
Cheetah baby 
Harry I'm so glad you came 
Jane I was so worried about you 
When I saw Tarzan alone 
You're not wounded 
No 
I was frightened 
We came as fast as we could 
You knew we were coming 
He was coming to help you 
Martin my friend 
Jane this is Martin Arlington my partner 
I think I can understand that 
Yes you're one of our set now 
Did you think I was never coming back 
I knew you'd be back 
But you know it's been a year 
It's been a long year too 
There were times I thought we'd never make it 
Tarzan will guide you the rest of the way 
He will 
I promised Harry 
That's perfect 
Jane I want to talk to you for hours 
But some of my men are hurt 
I should take care of them first 
Is there any water here 
Yes there's a stream over there 
He says he'll help you with your men 
That's fine 
Come along 
Well I can't say I don't care about a fortune 
You're hurt 
It's nothing a Gaboni arrow 
They're poisonous 
Careful Tarzan it's hot 
Hot 
Yes it's coffee 
I don't think you'll like it darling 
Like it 
You never drink anything hot 
Never 
Don't you miss it Jane things like this 
Yes Tarzan 
Where is he going 
To build a house 
Build a house 
It doesn't take Tarzan long 
We have a mansion in every glade 
Don't you ever want to come back 
No Harry 
And possibly a number three 
Yes I've noticed the scarcity of women 
That's not very flattering to me 
Meeting you is what made me conscious of it 
Like a hungry man outside a restaurant window 
Don't you miss the fun you used to have 
I have fun 
Moonlight on the Thames 
Dance 
Real people 
I wonder 
Well at least the men are civilized 
Does that make them any better 
For women 
Look at Cheetah 
There's your civilization for you 
Come on where's your vanity 
Wouldn't you like to get all dressed up again 
Not that I have any complaints on that score 
Why I had this specially designed for me 
What woman ever does 
No smart one 
Good 
Come along 
Why Harry 
What is it 
Harry's got a surprise for you 
Surprise 
You wait and see 
They're lovely 
I'm glad you like them 
Like them 
Harry they're gorgeous 
You are a darling 
Give me a little credit 
I shopped all over Paris to get them for you 
Look at this little thing 
But it's smart 
You look like the Jane Parker I used to know 
Makes me feel like her 
Not much good for climbing trees 
Not much 
These are rather sheer I think 
Give them to me 
Eyebrow pencil lipstick 
Indelible 
Doesn't come off when you're kissed 
I brought all the allurements 
I've done my share of shopping 
Lovely 
Well now I'd better find a dress 
How sweet of you to remember 
It's lined 
They're like that now 
They are 
Yes London's gone leg conscious 
I'm glad you haven't 
I like you just as you are 
How styles have changed haven't they 
Try it on 
Yes we'll clear out of your boudoir 
A gramophone 
Are we going to have music 
I'm going to try these on 
But I want you to understand 
it's not going to make any difference 
Difference 
You want me to go back 
You must go back 
Why 
You can't stay here 
Supposing anything happened to him 
You couldn't live 
I don't think I'd want to 
That's nonsense 
Suppose he were to die 
Why should he 
Anything can happen in this place 
Where would you be then 
Where would he be if I went back 
We'll let him come along too 
Tarzan over there 
Then he would die 
Come on 
You're holding up the show 
Right 
Run along 
I won't be a minute 
Go on 
She's priceless 
She's not interested in Mayfair 
Nonsense 
She's weakening already you lucky pup 
I don't think so 
You'll get her back 
This is raw nature old man 
Survival of fittest 
If she wants to go how can he stop her 
Good heavens Martin he's 
He's not an animal 
Please bwana 
Yes Saidi 
Moko bad sick 
Needle bad 
All right 
I'll give him a hypo 
Where is he Saidi 
Get out of there 
Come on 
What was that 
Safari boys curious about the music 
I love it 
Need any help 
Do you always help ladies to dress 
When they're lovely enough 
Voilà 
How's that 
Perfect 
And I thought improvement impossible 
You see 
Woman's greatest weapon is man's imagination 
Very becoming too 
Where's Harry 
Sick native 
He'll be away for a few minutes I hope 
Thank you 
Funny isn't it 
I imagine that isn't your usual practice 
Well everything seems to go by opposites here 
I believe I have this dance Lady Jane 
Oh yes 
Thank you 
You know you're a fascinating little savage 
Forgive me please 
I forgot myself 
You're so lovely 
I blame myself as much as you 
Please don't 
And that's Tarzan 
There's nothing in there 
That's music 
Music 
Music like the natives make on their tom toms 
This is a little bit more civilized 
Look 
That's right 
You'll be the talk of the town 
It's thrilling isn't it 
Yes the jungle does grow on one doesn't it 
Only very lately on me 
Adds to the fascination 
These are clothes 
That's why I wore these Tarzan 
I thought you'd like them 
Like them 
Those are stockings 
Like them 
Something provocative about the feel of silk 
Always was 
Same curiosity he had about the phonograph 
It's perfume 
I think Tarzan approves 
No go 
No Tarzan 
Harry can't you and I have a dance 
Most assuredly 
No go 
Harry perhaps it is getting a little late 
I'm sorry 
You're a bad boy 
Good morning 
I love you 
You never forget do you Tarzan 
Never forget I love you 
Love who 
Love you 
Love who 
Love Jane 
Love my 
My wife 
So you've been out shopping early 
Or did you spend the night at the club 
Now you can't get around me like that 
Are you sure there isn't another woman 
Woman 
Man 
That's the way it should be Tarzan 
I love you 
Happy 
Then you'd be unhappy 
Unhappy 
What 
Swim 
All right 
Just a minute 
Now you mustn't grumble dear 
Swim 
for their wives to get dressed 
Swim 
Darling I have to put on clothes 
I love you 
Good morning early bird 
Did you get your worm this morning 
That's fine 
Wait Tarzan 
Darling you're very 
Throw that down to me Cheetah 
Give that to me 
Cheetah that isn't funny 
Throw it down to me Cheetah 
Can't you see I've got nothing on 
Give it to me 
That's a good monkey 
Darling come here 
They're not bad ones anyway 
Jane are you all right 
Of course 
Why wouldn't I be 
Hello Harry 
What is it Martin 
Sure we're going right 
Tarzan said a perfectly straight line 
There must be an easier way 
This is like trying to shovel quicksand 
I might if he'd quit yodeling and help us out 
Saidi have we been going straight 
Yes bwana 
I'm going to try a detour 
Cut off to the left where it's not so thick 
Afraid we'll lose our direction 
Anything's better than this continued hacking 
Come on swing over you blighters 
Martin my friend 
You're off the track 
Tarzan has taken care of that 
That's all right Harry 
That's fine 
Thanks 
Down Cheetah 
About an hour 
That's an excellent idea 
Cheerio 
Going through the jungle is play for them 
Stop it 
They're just playing 
I wonder what they do for exercise 
No Tarzan 
Don't 
That's no way to treat a lady 
Fun is fun but 
Fun 
Stop it 
Wait till I get my breath 
You're going to carry me from now on 
Now that wasn't fair 
How much further is it 
I'm glad that's over 
Jane learn 
Jane learn Tarzan 
Tarzan learn Jane 
Well I must have graduated today 
Graduated 
They can make camp here 
And I want a nice house with a river view 
It's good to rest here 
Thank you darling 
Now lazy get up 
You've got work to do 
Go on and see what's happened to the safari 
Good Cheetah 
Cheetah look out 
I'm all right dear but Cheetah 
Good Cheetah 
Hello 
A rhino do that 
She got in front of it to save me 
She's gone Little Cheetah 
There there Cheetah 
The hurt will die down 
It has to 
Otherwise none of us could stand life 
Come back 
Tarzan doesn't want you to go there 
I'm only shaken up 
But you are you all right 
Very well thank you 
Tarzan no 
We have to get the safari started 
Come on 
Good morning 
We've been up for hours 
Would you like some coffee 
No thank you 
Jane tell me 
Could Tarzan really call more elephants 
A whole herd 
He won't believe me 
Yes 
Why 
We can use them as a pack train 
Carry tons more ivory away 
Of course 
Why that's a grand idea 
I don't know why I didn't think of it 
Tarzan we want you to get more elephants 
No dear 
All the elephants 
Every one 
Yes dear 
Back 
Yes 
Mahowoni sleep 
That's why they're going to the burial ground 
To get the ivory 
It will make them rich 
It's no good to us just lying there 
Mahowoni sleep 
I promised them Tarzan 
Mahowoni sleep 
What does he think we wanted to go there for 
I hadn't thought 
You see Tarzan has no objectives 
He just goes somewhere because he wants to 
And then my father's buried there 
He went with us before 
You didn't try to take away any ivory 
Can't you persuade him 
I'll try Harry 
Are you sure you don't know the way yourself 
No not without him 
Did he guide you before 
No we followed a dying elephant 
A dying elephant 
Yes I told you about that 
It's elephant's instinct 
Dying elephant 
What did he say 
He'll take you back but he won't go on 
But he's got to understand 
Tarzan knows nothing about money 
That wouldn't mean anything to him 
What's the harm 
They're all dead 
But these are animals 
They're not humans 
This is different 
Not to him 
I had no right to promise for him 
Tarzan is the only law here: 
the jungle's and mine 
Won't you let us guide you back 
I'm going on 
I've got too much at stake 
I'm sorry Harry 
But didn't he understand 
If I can't have one guide I'll have another 
Martin wait 
Hold up 
Stop it 
Don't Tarzan 
Put him down 
Bad Martin my friend 
You just don't understand darling 
Tarzan wait 
Harry we're leaving 
You won't come back with us 
I belong with him 
Goodbye 
I'm here for ivory 
What about you 
I'm with you 
All right Saidi 
We'll follow its trail 
Yes bwana 
Where's she heading for now 
Straight through the waterfalls 
That's the way we went before 
Through them 
Yes 
All right Saidi 
They always do somehow 
God it's like a city paved with gold 
Let's pack out as soon as we can 
Next trip we'll bring 1 000 men 
Let's get started 
Elephants' ghosts 
No 
Jane's father is buried over there 
Saidi 
Yes bwana 
Load up the tusks 
We'll pack right out 
No exceptions 
Yes bwana 
What are these boys doing with boxes 
Boys carry food 
Eat bwana 
Come on boys 
Everybody carries ivory 
We don't need any spearmen Come on 
We'll be trampled to death 
Dead men can't give orders 
Yes they can 
Tarzan wait 
Tarzan I've got to talk to them first 
You must wait 
Wait 
You must 
Won't you give up this idea 
You're my people 
Perhaps after all we are wrong 
What 
The elephants are Tarzan's friends 
That's generous of you 
Tarzan will guide us back now won't he 
Yes 
They won't take the ivory 
They understand 
Yes of course 
Perhaps we can stay here for tonight 
The boys are dog tired 
and there's no hurry now 
Of course 
Tarzan will send them back 
Saidi have the boys start a fire 
Yes bwana 
Lantern Saidi 
Thank you 
Her father's grave 
This was my father's 
I want you to wear it always 
Always 
Good morning 
I love you 
Always 
Yes darling always 
Hurry back to me Tarzan 
Back 
Not a trace 
He can't be gone 
Jane you must face facts 
They're cruel but you must 
Why he's fought a hundred crocodiles 
He didn't see it 
I shouted 
He turned but there was nothing he could do 
He might have got away 
Jane you've got to look after yourself 
Did you find any 
Sorry 
But there must be some traces 
Even if he were 
He said Always 
Wait 
Take me away 
You're dead tired aren't you Jane 
I'm all right 
The walking helps 
You're very brave 
No 
If I were I should be back there 
With Tarzan's memory 
Answer me honestly Jane 
If we carried it back 
Supposing she had said Take it back 
Strange about that croc 
I thought you'd gone 
Well she didn't desert you after all 
In the jungle fidelity goes to the living 
Everywhere 
There there Cheetah 
That's all right 
You can go with me 
What is it 
What is it Cheetah 
She's trying to tell me something 
Perhaps you should leave her here in freedom 
They die in captivity 
Tarzan's alive 
What 
He's alive 
Tarzan's alive 
I wish he were but 
But he is 
She wants to take me to him 
It's impossible 
Do you believe this Jane 
I know it 
Harry I've got to go to him 
Then we'll go with you 
Saidi halt them 
Jane you're chasing a shadow 
He's alive somewhere 
We'll follow Cheetah 
Where 
Behind and over there 
Juju bwana 
What tribe 
New country bwana 
No tell 
All right 
Get them started 
Straight ahead 
But Harry we've got to get through to Tarzan 
That way 
It's blocked 
We'll save ourselves first 
Cheetah can show us the way after 
Come back here you 
Pick up that ivory 
Pick it up 
Ivory doesn't count now 
I'm holding on 
We might rush them 
The moment we raise a gun they'll be on us 
They've never seen a gun 
We can get past 
All right we'll try it 
Ready Martin 
Now 
Get the ammunition box 
I wish we had that box of ammunition 
Cover me 
Wait a minute 
You're a better shot than I am 
Yes I know 
I'm a faster runner too 
Don't waste your ammunition 
We can't kill them all 
Cheetah come back 
Deserting us 
No she isn't 
She's going to get Tarzan 
Go on Cheetah 
She'll make it 
Cheetah go on 
I know who they are 
Tarzan calls them the men that eat lions 
Eat lions 
They're staking Saidi out 
Come back you can't save him 
Harry come back 
Stand guard on the ledge 
What does 
You 
Always gone 
No dear 
Always is just beginning for you and me

The very brilliant agent 
of a certain foreign power 
I tracked two of his men to that music hall 
Unfortunately they recognized me 
That's why they're after me now 
That was too bad 
You don't believe me 
Frankly I don't 
Go and look down into the street then 
You win 
Are they there 
Yes 
I'd hoped I'd shaken them off 
But now that they have followed me here 
you are in it as much as I am 
How do you mean 
Have you ever heard of the 39 Steps 
No 
What's that a pub 
Never mind 
But what you were laughing at is true 
These men will stop at nothing 
I'm the only person who can stop them 
before the secret is out 
Why don't you phone the police 
These men act quickly 
You don't know how clever their chief is 
Clever and ruthless 
Who is he 
What's his name 
But one thing he cannot disguise: 
this 
Part of his little finger is missing 
be very careful my friend 
Thanks I'll make a note of it 
Meanwhile what are you going to do 
First I'll eat my haddock 
have a good night's rest 
You're welcome to my bed 
I'll get a shakedown on the couch 
Anything else I can get you 
A map of Scotland 
Why Scotland 
Are the 39 Steps in Scotland by any chance 
Perhaps I'll tell you tomorrow 
Clear out Hannay 
They'll get you next 
What you were laughing at just now is true 
These men will stop at nothing 
There's a man in Scotland 
It is only a matter of days perhaps hours 
before the secret is out of the country 
I tell you these men act quickly 
Quickly 
Quickly 
Could you use a pound note brother 
What's the catch 
l want to borrow your cap and coat 
What's all this 
What's the big idea 
l want to make a getaway 
To a bunk 
Yes 
What have you been up to 
l'll have to trust you 
There's been a murder up on the first floor 
By you 
No by those two men out there 
It's quite true 
They're spies foreigners 
Come off it 
Funny jokes at 5:00 in the morning 
All right 
I'll tell you the truth 
Are you married 
Yes but don't rub it in 
What's the idea now 
l'm not I'm a bachelor 
A married woman lives on the first floor 
Does she 
Yes I've just been paying her a call 
Now do you see 
Why didn't you tell me before 
I only wanted to be told 
Here put this on 
Put on my hat 
There you are 
Take the pound

God made the country 
ls the supper ready woman 
Aye 
Do you mind if I look at your paper 
l don't mind 
Thank you 
You did not tell me your name 
Hammond 
Of course 
O Lord make us truly thankful 
for them and for all Thy manifold blessings 
Continually turn our hearts 
from wickedness 
and from worldly things 
unto Thee 
Amen

She was only trying to help me 
Aye to bring shame and disgrace upon my house 
She was helping me to escape from the police 
The police 
Yes they're after me for murder 
What 
They're here 
She was only warning me 
I had to tell her last night 
Don't let them in 
Say I'm not here 
I'll make it worth your while 
How much 
Five pounds 
Have you got that much 
Give it to me 
After they've gone

But he took the money 
He could not resist it 
Here 
Have you seen a stranger about here 
What kind of a stranger 
I was right 
Now's your time 
Your jacket's terrible light colored 
I'm a feared they'll see you 
You best take this one

His son's but never mind 
They must not see you

He'll not ill treat you 
He'll pray at me but no more 
What's your name 
Margaret 
Good bye Margaret 
I'll never forget you for this 
There he goes 
Spread out in a line 
ls the master in 
What name should I say sir 
He wouldn't know my name 
Ask if he knows Miss Annabella Smith 
Would you wait here while I inquire 
Yes Go on 
We'd better make inquiries here 
Somebody may have seen him through the windows 
There's been a couple motorcars here 
Aye 
Murderers do not make calls in motorcars 
Good day dear 
The same to you 
Have you seen any strangers this morning 
or calling at the house 
No sir 
You're from Annabella Smith 
Yes 
Give me five minutes then we can talk 
Of course 
Come meet my wife 
Louisa my dear 
I've another guest for you 
This is Mr l forgot to ask your name 
Hammond 
There's a police inspector at the door 
He wants to speak to you 
At the door 
All right 
I'll deal with it 
Take him in my dear 
Come and meet my daughters 
This is Patricia 
How do you do 
Mrs Bailey 
Mrs Hutchins 
Hilary my dear this is Mr Hammond 
He just arrived from London 
How do you do 
Forgive the orgy 
This is Captain and Mrs Ogilvey 
How do you do 
Have a drink 
Thank you 
This is Derek Stewart 
And this is Sheriff Watson 
You've got to be polite to him 
He's our Sheriff Substitute 
Scotch for a local beak 
It's all right 
Don't worry 
I've sent them away 
Come and look at the view from this window 
We're rather proud of it 
When will you catch that murderer 
What murderer 
He's here in the district 
How exciting 
Where 
Somewhere about 
He's been on the moors 
Sheriff Ames why don't you catch him 
It's no business of mine to catch him 
You catch him and I'll convict him 
ls there a reward 
lt's nearly 1 :00 
We must leave 
The professor wants his lunch 
There's no hurry my dear 
Yes sir 
Are you coming out 
Come show us your new car 
Come again another time 
Good bye 
We'd love to 
Bring him along 
Good bye 
Louisa if you'll excuse us 
What about our mutual friend Annabella 
She's been murdered 
Murdered 
The Portland Mansions affair 
Why our friends outside are looking for you 
l didn't do it 
Of course you didn't 
Did she tell you what he looked like 
There wasn't time 
One thing: 
Part of his little finger was missing 
Which one 
This one I think 
Sure it wasn't this one 
Lunch is ready dear 
l'm coming right away 
Or should it be up 
I never can remember 
It seems to be the wrong garden all right 
Well 
What are we going to do 
That's just the point 
What are we going to do about it 
I live here as a respectable citizen 
if it became known that I'm not what I seem 
Mr Hannay why have you come here 
There's my wife and daughters to think of 
I don't know what to think 
Really I don't 
Yes I've got it 
Poor Annabella would have been too late 
That's fair 
Yes 
What about it 
What about what 
Yourself 
lt seems there's only one way out 
What's that 
Supposing I left you alone with this revolver 
had taken his own life 
l thought you were coming directly 
We've all been waiting 
Will Mr Hammond be staying 
l don't think so dear 
Well what do you think Mr Hannay 
I'm afraid you leave me no alternative 
I cannot find my hymn book 
Where did you leave it 
It was hanging here 
And this bullet stuck among the hymns eh 
I'm not surprised 
I've stuck in them myself before now 
I'm not complaining Sheriff 
Hymns that have helped me 
That's a good one 
That's fine 
And how did you escape 
If you look through the window you'll see 
They put the body in the dressing room 
This is serious 
Otherwise I wouldn't put myself in your hands 
with a murder charge hanging over me 
Never heed the murder 
as easily as you've convinced me 
Thank you 
Are you wishing to see me 
indeed I am 
Murderer 
Certainly 
Take him over to the county jail 
Every word of my story is true 
He's my best friend in the district 
Get me Professor Jordan 
That's easy 
From one of your pursuers on the moor 
lsn't that so Inspector 
l had a shot at him myself 
You better do that from London 
You'll be there soon enough 
It'll save you the cost of a trunk call 
That's the professor's car 
Hannay must be inside spilling the beans 
Stop him 
My God 
How do you do 
We're all waiting for you 
Pamela's gone to meet you at the station 
This way 
Leader and standard bearer himself 
at this critical and momentous hour 
But first of all as a preliminary to this 
l shall occupy your time 
You've occupied too much time already 
We've had enough of you 
Speak up 
There's no need to say who he is 
He is now one of the foremost figures 
How important it is 
I now ask for Captain Fraser 
but I'd entirely failed while listening 
to realize he was talking about me 
and with the utmost sincerity 
how delighted and relieved I am to find myself 
in your presence at this moment 
Delighted because of your friendly reception 
I am delivered from the cares and anxieties 
When I journeyed up to Scotland a few days ago 
A very different program 
You'd be for the moors to shoot something 
Or somebody 
I'm a rotten shot 
in support of that brilliant young statesman 
That rising 
The gentleman on my right 
no uncertain mark in politics 
your candidate Mr 
He doesn't know the candidate's name 
in anticipation mark you 
at Westminster 
What shall it be 
The herring fisheries 
Unemployment 
What about the idle rich 
That's an old fashioned topic 
Have you ever worked with your hands 
and have the whole world against me 
I ask your candidate 
and all those who love their fellowmen 
A world where no nation plots against nation 
where no neighbor plots against neighbor 
where there is no persecution or hunting down 
and where people try to help and not to hinder 
A world from which suspicion and cruelty 
and fear have been forever banished 
That is the sort of world I want 
is that the sort of world you want 
Fine 
That's all I have to say 
Good night 
l kept them going as long as I could 
You're a difficult man to follow 
I suppose you think you've been damn clever 
Tell your prisoner not to insult me 
Try and stop me 
Come along with me 
l was speaking the truth 
You must have seen I was genuine 
to High Commissioner for Canada in London 
Tell him an important secret 
That will do now 
Has that penetrated 
Right to the funny bone 
Now tell me another one 
Haven't you any sense at all 
Put that call through 
I beg of you 
Refer them to me 
Will you do this 
No 
Good night 
Whatever for 
To identify the prisoner formally 
Will you come to the police station 
What 
lt's only for a few minutes 
lf it's necessary let's get it over 
Now you 
Must I sit next to this man 
lt's only for a short time 
Be as quick as you can 
All right 
Isn't that the police station 
We're running past it 
Tell the man 
You must have misunderstood me 
We're not exactly going to this police station 
Where are we going 
Inverary 
Yes miss 
We have orders to take him there 
You have no orders to take me 
No miss but I'm afraid you must go 
I'll see you're sent back as early as possible 
How far is it to Inverary 
Forty miles 
Keep quiet 
Sorry 
We'll be there in less than two hours 
l'm spending half the night with you 
It looks like it 
Isn't the man going the wrong way 
Surely that's the way to Inverary 
There's a bridge fallen down on that road 
We shall have to go around 
The man knows the way 
Might I see your warrant 
Shut your mouth 
You'll see it soon 
All right I'll have it with you Sherlock 
has the top joint of his little finger missing 
What about it 
I win 
What are we stopping for 
It's a whole flock of detectives 
They're all over the road 
Get out and clear them away 
What about him 
l'll soon fix that 
There miss Now you're a Special Constable 
What's the idea 
As long as you stay he stays 
Yes and as long as I go you go 
Come on 
Stop them 
They got away 
Come on 
l won't 
Won't you 
You're hurting me 
Shut up 
See if they've gone down that way 
Where could they have gone 
Help 
Let me go 
There's nobody down here I tell you 
Spread out and find them 
They must be a mile away by now 
Don't do that 
Do stop whistling 
You can't possibly escape 
What chance have you got tied to me 
What's the use of this 
They may get me but they're not policemen 
When did you find that out 
You found that out yourself 
I see 
Oh 
Listen once more 
I'm telling you the truth 
I'm telling you now for the third time 
only ones who can stop it 
The gallant knight to the rescue 
How do you come out over that 
I don't know how innocent you may be 
who'd stop at nothing to get you off his hands 
I'm not afraid of 
For all you know I may murder a woman a week 
So listen to a bit of advice 
You big bully 
I like your pluck 
Come on 
We're going in there 
What for 
That's my business 
Remember what I said: the civil tongue or else 
Has that penetrated the ivory dome 
Only just 
Pull yourself together 
Put your hand in my pocket and look in a hurry 
Come along 
Come in 
The young lady's terrible wet 
You'll be staying the night 
Yes 
But you'll not be minding that 
No quite the reverse 
You're man and wife I suppose 
Yes 
Uh yes 
Have you any luggage 
We left that behind in the car 
Maybe I could lend the young lady a nightgown 
Will you please to register 
James the book 
Aye 
l'll light the fire for you 
Will you be needing supper 
No thank you 
Just a whiskey and soda and a few sandwiches 
And a glass of milk 
Very well sir 
You can guess what's in this pocket 
You sign darling 
I'll be back in a minute chaps 
Thanks all the same 
No doubt the gentleman will take care of you 
Good night sir Good night ma'am 
Good night 
Good night

l do not care 
They are so terrible in love with each other 
I'm going to tell them the whole story 
Let me go 
Of course 
What else can you do 
Can I come in 
Come here 
Come in 
We were just getting warm before the fire 
Thank you very much 
You'd like a hot water bottle wouldn't you 
Say yes darling 
Yes darling 
Very well 
Please don't go 
Why not

Of course there's nothing wrong 
She just wants to tell you something 
We're a runaway couple 
l knew it 
They're after you 
You won't give us away will you 
Please 
Of course we will not give you up 
A good night to you both 
You'll not be disturbed 
But 
Thank God for a bite to eat 
Come along 
There you are 
What's the next item on the program 
Get these things off Right 
How will we set about it 
Anything in that bag of yours that will help 
A pair of scissors or a hairpin 
Do you think a nail file would help 
Let's make ourselves comfortable 
What about that skirt of yours 
It's still pretty damp 
Take it off I don't mind 
l'll keep it on thank you 
And that is that 
My shoes and stockings are soaked 
I think I'll take them off 
Can I be of any assistance 
No thank you 
Sorry 
Hold this 
Yeah 
Half a minute 
Thank you 
Don't mention it 
Do you like your milk now 
No thank you I'll wait a little 
All right 
Cheerio 
That's better 
Are your feet quite warm again 
Yes thanks 
Come on 
Nobody's gonna hurt you 
This is Armistice Day 
Let's get some rest while we can 
l'm not going to lie on this bed 
We're the Siamese twins 
Don't gloat 
What a sight you'll be 
Give me that nail file 
Let's have a go at this 
Thank you 
There I go again 
I wonder where l heard it 
You sound very sleepy 
Sleepy 
I'll say so 
Do you know when I last slept in a bed 
Saturday night whenever that was 
Then I only got a couple of hours 
What made you wake so soon Dreams 
What do you mean dreams 
But only at the first 
Got over that a long time ago 
l was a most sensitive child 
You surprise me 
But one gets hardened 
How did you start 
Quite a small way like most of us 
then smash and grab and so on to plain burglary 
Killed my first man when I was 19 
to Madame Tussaud's and point me out 
Which section 
lt's early to say I'm still young 
What's the matter 
This handcuff is pinching my wrist 
Sorry 
What began 
My career of crime 
All hereditary 
Great Uncle Penruddock 
Who was he 
My girl where were you brought up 
Got it all from him 
l thought your family came from Canada 
He murdered three wives and got away with it 
Did she succeed 
No he was too quick for her 
He's in Madame Tussaud's 
There's no doubt about his department 
You must go down and see him sometime 
Can't mistake him 
Third on the left as you go in 
Red whiskers and a harelip 
That lady is the sad story of my life 
Poor orphan boy who never had a chance 
Are you still set on giving me up to the police 
You're sure everything's going to be all right 
Bound to be 
He can't have much time 
Be careful 
Wire to me 
Good bye my dear 
Good bye

Can I speak to Mrs Jordan then

He's gone to London already 
lf you manage I'd like hot whiskey 
l'll get the hot water 
Very good ma'am I see 
Yes ma'am 
Well 
The old man's got the wind up 
He's cleared out already 
Whatever for 
He's warning the whole 39 Steps 
Has he got the you know 
Yes 
Here's toddy 
That will be half a crown 
And the phone call 
We'll say a schilling 
ls this a hotel as well 
Aye 
Do you have people staying here 
Aye 
You get a few this time of year 
Aye 
Did you have anyone in tonight 
Aye 
They weren't by any chance a young couple 
James do not finish 
What kind of a silly creature am I married to 
Do you want to get us all jailed 
How much did you take for these 
Half a crown 
Out the pair of you 
Ohh 
You old fool 
Would you give away a young couple 
Good morning 
What's the idea 
How did we get out of these 
Why didn't you run away 
l did but just as I was going 
I decided to stay 
Those two men were in here last night 
I overheard them telephoning 
What did they say 
A lot of stuff about the 39 Steps 
You 
Go on 
What 
Someone's going to warn them 
How can you warn steps 
Never mind 
Go on 
Yes and there was another thing 
Someone got scared and is clearing out and 
Yes I know 
London Palladium 
What the devil 
What does he want to go there for 
I feel such a fool not having believed you 
That's all right 
We ought to get a move on 
What room are those two men in 
No room 
They went as soon as they telephoned 
They what 
Didn't I tell you 
You let them go after hearing what they said 
You button headed little idiot 
Don't talk to me like that 
Four or five precious hours wasted 
Why didn't you wake me up at once 
Why not leave well enough alone 
Let well alone 
Good girl I'm accused of murder 
You still can 
The man's going to the London Palladium 
Really 
First or second house 
I'll get there five hours late 
Fine 
The show will suit you 
What's that 
Crazy Month 
You're quite right madame 
that would be of any use to a spy 
I'm certain about it 
Since you phoned us from Scotland this morning 
we've made the minutest inquiries 
It's obvious I'm wasting my time here 
Just a moment miss please 
There's one thing you haven't told us 
Where's Richard Hannay

Father dear we shall find it 
You're coming with me now

Then you have his name on your register 
He has the place of honor 
Killed 
Dead 
The child is dead Excellency 
One or the other of you is forever in the way

Irritating episode 
The marquis drives fast 
We'll drive him fast to his tomb 
My dear nephew what goes forward here 
I'm leaving I'm going to England 
Really 
I can't endure your cruelty 
You have no pity for those who suffer 
Do you pity the swine whose flesh we eat 
The peasants are not swine 
Most of our lands are stolen 
I intend to see them returned to the peasants 
Really 
I'm not frightened of anything you can do 
A pleasant journey Mr Darnay 
What did he mean by that 
The steel hand in the velvet glove 
But he's capable of anything 
I'm not troubled Gabelle 
Charles let me go with you 
God bless you Charles 
On the boat to England you say Morveau 
Darnay will be arrested the day he lands 
You are ingenious Morveau 
I like your plan 
Proceed with it 
Very well Your Excellency 
The boy is capricious He needs correction 
Yes Your Excellency 
It's been a pleasant voyage 
Your kindness has done me good much good 
It's nice to be one's self again 
Really Mr Darnay 
Now you're making sport of me 
Oh no Mr Darnay it was most edifying 
Ahoy ashore 
All right hand me my luggage my bag

Bon voyage 
Barsad 
On such short acquaintance

Thank you Mr Darnay for all your kindness 
Goodbye then until Sunday 
Goodbye 
Goodbye young man until Sunday 
That's him there 
But he calls himself Darnay Charles Darnay 
Really not working yet Carton 
This is too much 
You've got to put your mind on this case 
No not possible 
They've got this Charles Darnay up for treason 
I don't know Charles Darnay 
It's not my consideration he wants it's yours 
Why don't you give it to him 
Of course I count on you for a little help 
You don't need me 
You're the great barrister Stryver 
Well if I am it's due to perseverance 
I had to get into the front rank 
I wasn't born there was I 
I use my brains 
You use mine you mean 
Well if I do I pay you for it 
But this is a treason case 
It's a matter of life and death 
Well so is everything else 
I don't hesitate 
But I tell you Darnay is lost 
Barsad and Cly 
A case like that could be tried on mere sound 
What are you talking about 
Darnay Charles Darnay 
Equally manifestly a gentleman 
Barsad 
Barsad 
I seem to know that name 
Barsad Yes he was 
Your life is in my hands 
I may lead you to fortune or the grave 
Who knows and who cares 
I think I'll call on Jerry 
Why he's a grave robber 
Now a man who employs me shouldn't be a snob 
But he's a grave robber 
Do you know the most interesting thing to me 
Saving an innocent man from a horrible death 
You're in luck Stryver 
I'll lay you a wager I'll drink you a victory 
Oh dear Lord don't let him be a grave robber 
Oh dear God 
Bust me if she ain't at it again 
A grave robber 
Don't say that word 
I'm a resurrectionist that's what I am 
Quiet you 
And I tell you I won't be took the liberty with 
Father I think she's flopping again 
What more flopping 
No no no I was meditating 
And I won't have you meditating neither 
Jerry 
How are you Mr Carton 
Not rusty huh 
Oh no sir 
Good You'll never see them rusty again 
Jerry do you know a man called Cly 
No I don't believes I do sir 
Oh Barsad 
I knows him sir 
A great fellow for bowling 
Where do I find him 
Good 
Neither will Mr Barsad 
Hey whose idea was it 
Mine I did all the brainwork 
Oh I see 
Run away with the swag 
In a really hard school of experience 
That's right Made up my mind same thing 
Nobody Never trust nobody 
But them swine did you get back at them 
Did I get ba 
Did I fix something up on them 
Did you plant something on them 
You got a brain 
What did you plant on them 
Where did you see them 
Outside Newgate Prison 
Newgate 
With my own eyes 
First hung up and then quartered 
Drawn and quartered 
Treason You got them for treason 
You're a great man Barsad You guessed it 
Treason eh 
Now Barsad match that if you can 
Right I will match it 
Put there by no other than your humble servant 
Then doff it right now 
Wait till I tell you how I did it 
No another drink first 
There's plenty of time 
No no Now let me tell you 
I thought they might be valuable 
So thinks I to myself: 
You know I I likes doing that sort of thing 
Yes milord 
My duty sir 
Your duty to your country 
Yes sir 
Your duty as a patriotic Englishman 
Your duty as a shining citizen 
Your Honor I protest 
Silence in court 
No levity gentlemen 
That's all Mr Barsad 
Your witness 
No questions now 
Later on if you're not too silly we'll 
No questions now Beg pardon milord 
Here are the lists if you care to examine them 
Have these been in the prisoner's possession 
Yes milord 
Can't be too careful you know 
Jail fever 
Very prevalent 
I now call Miss Lucie Manette 
Miss Manette have you seen the prisoner before 
Oh most unhappily yes 
Where did you first meet him 
When the gentleman came onboard I 
If you mean the prisoner say the prisoner 
He was very kind and good to my father 
To us both 
The prisoner understands that or should 
What was it 
Be particular 
Oh he made treasonable remarks like that 
There was no harm in the way he said this 
It was said only to beguile the time 
We'll leave that for the jury to decide 
That will be all Miss Manette 
Your witness 
No questions milord 
Last night 
Services 
My guess is he stole the collection box 
Where were you last night 
At home Working 
Working Mr Barsad 
Just what is your profession 
Gentleman 
Retired of course 
And on what do you live 
On my property 
Where is it 
Well I I haven't any just now 
Oh then at present you're not living 
Silence in court 
Mr Barsad have you ever been kicked 
Certainly not 
Come come Mr Barsad 
Weren't you one time kicked down stairs 
Oh I see You were maligned 
Do you know a French marquis 
No sir 
No 
A relative of the prisoner's 
No sir 
No 
Now I want you to be very very careful 
After all all we want is the truth 
Yes sir 
Couldn't have made a mistake 
No sir 
Couldn't have mistaken him for me for instance 
Oh no sir 
Or his lordship perhaps 
Piffle 
No sir 
Why 
Now you seem to think otherwise 
No I 
That's all milord 
As far as I'm concerned it's quite sufficient 
The pith and marrow as it were 
Oh really Oh yes quite so quite so 
Oh Mr Carton if you'll excuse me 
Charles 
Mr Darnay will be acquitted won't he 
Mr Stryver's defense was brilliant 
Wonderful 
Young sir give credit where credit is due 
Would you tell him for me 
Might tell against the prisoner

What is your verdict 
Not guilty 
Prisoner dismissed

You were a bachelor in your cradle 
But 
Charles have you seen Sydney

Why Sydney why didn't you come to the wedding 
Pleasant ceremonies weddings 
Marry her against a rainy day 
Drives me mad 
Suggest marriage to you and you fly up 
If you'd only seen the joy in Lucie's eyes 
Why should that surprise me 
Why shouldn't she be happy 
Why shouldn't she be 
I go 
He goes 
Henri Dupont 42 francs quit rental 
Not enough Gabelle 
What about Roulet Has he paid his rent 
No Your Excellency nor will he 
Roulet died last week 
Oh what did he die of 
You think that one person is as good as another 
A naive notion so contradicted by the facts 
But speaking of 
Do you hear from him Gabelle 
Oh yes He is very happy 
He has taken a post at Tellson's Bank 
Frightfully bourgeois 
His conduct is so strange 
It's quite mystifying 
What was that Gabelle 
What Your Excellency 
I thought I saw somebody at the window 
Certainly 
Gentlemen 
Monsieur Gabelle 
Your forgiveness gentlemen 
It's of no consequence 
Believe me no consequence 
Proceed Monsieur Gabelle 
All the people ask is justice 
And what do you suggest Gabelle 
That we double the police force 
Double the police 
No Give the people bread 
Reduce their taxes 
Enough of this Gabelle 
Mercenaries to fight Frenchmen 
Shall we rejoin the ladies gentlemen 
I think he's right about the peasants 
It doesn't matter how many 
It will do them no good It'll do them no good 
Any minute 
Want this wood in the loft 
Name is Barsad 
Good day 
Cognac the very best 
Never mind the cost 
These foreign soldiers are gonna fi 
They march well don't they 
Very well 
You knit with great skill madam 
What sort of things do you make 
Everything mostly shrouds 
Shrouds 
Business seems bad 
Business is very bad 
People are so poor 
The unfortunate miserable people 
And so oppressed too as you say 
As you say 
I think 
All we think here is how to live 
Good health Jacques 
My name is Ernest De Farge 
De Farge 
Didn't you used to work for Dr Manette 
Yes 
You know I met him in England 
He has a charming daughter 
Little grandchild now too 
Grandchild 
Oh yes His daughter married Charles Darnay 
You must remember him 
You must have known the marquis 
No Why should I 
You remember that Jacques 
His name is Ernest 
I don't want to make a mistake in your name 
I don't believe it 
No no it's not true 
That is to end him 
We don't 
I count on the people's sanity and good temper 
No comparison at all that I can see 
Oh stuff and nonsense 
You're badly informed 
Oh bless my soul 
They differ as other classes do 
I agree 
And we have come to the conclusion 
Is not up to your usual standard 
As to that you haven't got one 
Excuse me gentlemen 
You're her favorite Sydney 
And she's mine 
She accepts me without criticism 
Doesn't even object to my drinking 
The perfect friend 
Well when there's any hope of reformation yes 
But with me it's hopeless 
I don't believe it I refuse to believe it 
Oh I admit that once when 
Must it end in nothing 
I'm afraid so 
I feel in you still such possibilities 
No they'll never be realized 
I am like one who died young 
I'll never give up my hopes for you Sydney 
Never I know myself better 
But this I know too: 
Thank you Sydney 
God grant it may never be necessary 
Look at the crowd rushing to escape the storm 
Listen to the echoes 
Meat 
Yes meat 
Stop it 
Stop it 
Why do you endure it 
Why do you have to endure it 
Why 
Why 
Careful 
Aristos 
Children of aristos 
Living on the blood of peasants 
It's not true 
I've always fought for the people 
I taught Charles Darnay to love the people 
Ask him Then why isn't he here 
Why isn't he here to testify for you 
His word could save you 
But he's in England 
Why doesn't he return to testify for you 
Write him 
His answer will be the test 
He will come 
I'm sure he will 
Pen Paper 
Thank you Citizen Gabelle 
Thanks for giving us an aristocrat 
His last will and testament 
He is your friend 
The revolution will need friends 
Why yes 
Was that your child 
My child

Do you see this hand 
This is the hand that struck your master down 
Well you can't blame me

Good sir 
All right Jerry 
Very fitting 
Thank you sir 
It is still not too late for you to help me 
As a wife and mother I appeal to you 
No one showed us mercy 
But I am not an aristocrat 
I'm the daughter of a country doctor 
I'm one of the people just as you are 
I see that I can hope for nothing from you 
You have no pity no pity 
No citizeness none 
I'll thank you to leave the child alone 
And what's more don't grin at me boldface 
Here Ladybird drink this 
No 
Sydney there is still hope isn't there 
You think so don't you 
Of course there's hope 
But Father's been gone for hours 
He would be able to see him wouldn't he 
Yes Danton could save him 
Where did you get this Lucie 
A nice old lady gave it to me at the wine shop 
What wine shop is the child talking about 
The D The Defarge's We went there to 
Merciful heaven 
What is it 
Why are you whispering 
Father 
Father 
Have you 
Have you seen him 
Have you seen Danton 
What 
What name did you say 
Dan 
My work 
What have you done with my work 
My bench tools thread 
Haven't you any thread 
Father have you seen him 
You left to see Danton 
Father Don't you know me 
Charles You left to save Charles 
It's no use my dear 
He doesn't understand you 
I'll take him to his room 
Not just now 
Say it 
Why not say it 
There's no hope now 
Where is Father 
He's been delayed 
He'll be here soon 
I want my father 
Come with Pross Come come 
I want my father 
It's going to seem such a long time Sydney 
Afterwards 
If only I could see him 
Just once 
I can't even do that 
Lucie your father's calling for you 
Is there nothing we can do 
I think I know I can get to see Charles once 
You can 
How Oh I know of a man 
I spent the afternoon with him 
You have your permit to leave Paris 
Yes 
Oh you'd have to move fast 
But why 
These passes are valid for any time 
Until canceled 
Canceled 
But the doctor Lucie they're in no danger 
They are in great danger 
Little Lucie 
It's unthinkable 
Take the doctor's permit and the others 
And here's mine 
Keep it for me until tomorrow 
I don't understand 
What do you want me to do 
At 8:00 tomorrow have your horses ready 
Start definitely at 8 
If Lucie hesitates you must force her 
Do I wait for you 
Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied 
And then for England 
You don't wish to tell me anything more 
You never misunderstood me sir 
You were right 
Yours is a long life to look back on Mr Lorry 
I'm 78 
Long life Useful one 
Solitary bachelor 
Nobody will weep for me 
Wouldn't she weep for you 
Yes thank God I didn't quite mean what I said 
It is a thing to thank God for isn't it 
Why yes surely 
Would you mind if I borrowed that coat 
Certainly not 
I hope to do my part faithfully 
And I hope to do mine 
Good night Louis

Alright we'll put someone onto that 
So Sergeant you saw what happened tonight

His wife confirmed it Naturally 
She would if she's in it 
You'd better find some way of talking to her 
What the idea sir 
What's the point of all this wrecking 
Who's behind it 
It's the men they employ that we're after 
Don't you know that's very dangerous 
What 
Leaving the stuff like that lying about 
You'd be very pleased with yourself I suppose

I had to spend money too No doubt 
I think you'll agree I've earned my money 
You made London laugh

Deeds of darkness

You ought to know him 
Well

Pretty woman 
What's that got to do with it 
Oh I know 
What about Verloc 
I'm not so sure about that 
Your assistant um what — 
Hollingshead

Perhaps in a few days it will settle down 
There now Are you sure it was him 
Listen again 
I see his beak open Of course you did 
Me whistle 
Mmm hmm This way 
My daughter 
Now where's my key 
How very careless 
She oughtn't to let the child play out here 
Very dangerous

I don't know Nobody knows 
How do I start the mechanism

No not me This place I'm in 
Come and clean all that 
Where's Ted

Is it about the men who came here last night 
My husband has nothing to do with it 
I hope you're right 
Why do you say it like that 
Sabot — 
That blackout the other night do you remember 
My husband hasn't anything to do with sabotage 
He told me that night he'd been in all evening 
That wasn't true 
I saw him come back with my own eyes 
He wouldn't do anything to — 
Did these men arrive together or one by one 
Did you recognise any of them 
Stevie 
They're beauties 
Which one's the hen 
You are right 
Well there's plenty of time

They are feeling pinch this year 
I've heard that they are selling land

I heard it yesterday from their agent 
At the gambling tea house 
Huh please please 
Ha ha ha ha ha 
What have I not thought of 
A good new year a triumphant new year 
Good night Good bye 
We could buy land from the Great House 
Rice land 
But we haven't 
But how close it was 
Between this money and nothing 
Not even food 
That rice land is sure 
Do you think They'd kill me 
Well well I'm not afraid 
Money is concerned 
What is a fair price I have it in my hand

Well she said no more than the truths 
I can afford a piece of cloth I think 
Now I have 2 fields 
I bought it today from the Great House 
The land 
They said it was less than an inch 
And took all that silver as if it were nothing 
But I'll buy again and again 
Until my land is more than an inch 
Even in a house of a prince 
And you'll be a prince too 
And I'll buy more land and more land and 
What a pity We're so poor 
Yes yes Is less than nothing 
Yes yes 
You mighty gods You wise gods 
I had only 1 field now I have 5 
I had only 1 child now I have 3 
My eldest son planted his first rice today 
My youngest son is big enough to lead the ox 
Excuse me 
Now we haven't forgotten you 
And not ask for money so often 
I'll do that anyway 
Very gracefully 
Wong Loong Come up 
Wong Loong come up here 
Wong Loong 
Wong Loong will know he'll know what it is 
Wong Loong How would he know 
He is as slow witted as my woman 
Hey hey Well And what now 
Look Look 
An army 
No Virgins perhaps So many 
People from the North But why 
There must be famine in the North 
They're going south where there's food 
Famine Ha ha ha 
What ideas you have 
The woman is right 
I have seen it before 
That's what happens when a man has only 1 field 
But I have 5 
What talk is this 
It was famine that made me a slave 
It dries even if we carry it 
Well if the vines starve we'll all starve 
The wheats' gone And the rice 
Mother Mother 
You know we're not thieves 
But the ox is mine 
We're hungry Our children are hungry 
You should help us 
If I have money I would help you 
My nephew You can sell your land 
Sell my land 
Yes 
But then the money is gone and the land 
At least we could live well through the famine 
What good is this land now 
I must keep it for my sons 
The earth is good if we work it would feed us 
But how am I to live 
How am I to live 
Work As I do 
I'll not rob my sons to feed you 
You you Must we go hungry while you have land 
This land that you won't sell 
I'm not selling my land 
It's my life it's mine 
Yes And you'll bury them in it 
He's my friend my friend 
We're not hungry 
Mercy on me you powerful ones 
There's one who has plenty but he's a rich man 
He has food And I starve 
He has food And these good men starve 
Well what 
You have food We're starving 
You have food Food 
I have nothing I dig for roots for my children 
You have food hidden Food and silver 
Food 
Find it 
He's got it he's got it 
Wong Loong has food 
I told you he has food 
But it's earth 
It takes hunger and it's warm 
Ching Hunger makes man mad 
Come come You're little man now 
You won't cry Look Your sister doesn't cry 
Little one she never cries now 
What is it 
Why 
I'll find it 
Tomorrow I 
When have you had food 
No words but I know 
Oh Lang the earth has forgotten us 
The earth I hate it I'll sell it

But who was starving then 
Please Please 
And well you know I must sell 
No Not the land 
We'll not sell the land 
We'll keep it we'll go south 
And when we return we'll still have the land 
But I've arranged it 
I brought these men here you must sell 
Is it your land 
Did you buy it bit by bit 
What a pity What a pity 
How can you walk anywhere With the child 
The child is dead Dead 
But I heard it cry 
The child is dead 
What do you say father 
Shall we ride in this fire wagon 
It ain't safe for your old back 
He said it crawls on these iron poles 
Grandpa says it's a god of fire 
These wagons chained together 
Do it again find a thing 
We sit in it while it walks off 
With these mats we can build a home 
Well then get to work 
Get to work all of you 
You'll look at me and listen 
A heart good sir A heart good lady 
A good deed and you shall prosper 
The small cash a coin you throw away 
Feed us starving child 
The small cash feed the starving child 
Feed the good fortune Bring you a good heart 
Small cash for starving Poor little child 
Feed the good fortune Bring you a good heart 
Small cash for starving 
Hey hey

Meat Hey hey hey

It's mine 
Where did you get meat 
I took it from an old woman 
You stole it You thief 
Thief Thief 
Meat is meat 
Do we have to steal or beg for it to live 
A man can't stand it here 
Our land is all in the north 
You could sell little one 
I would sell her to take you back to the land 
What is it 
What happened 
He was pulling timber he fell and died 
Where did he work Where did he work 
At the great market 
Where are these soldiers going 
They say there's a revolution coming 
Revolution 
What is a revolution 
Things are growing again 
You were a farmer 
I own land in the north 
So did I 10 years ago 
Why don't you go back 
You gotta have an ox You gotta buy seeds 
You gotta live till you make the crop 
I tried saving up for 10 years 
I'll never get back and neither will you 
I'll get back 
If I can pull that thing I can pull a plough; 
ox or no ox 
In a few days China will be a free country; 
the day of tyranny is over 
The revolutionary army is on its way;

Fighting in the rain in the north

Very kind of you to buy my rigid grain 
The contract's ready father 
Well it is time 
But this contract is wrong 
Change it then 
They're stupid worthless preachers 
Hee hee hee

Indeed If I'm not too unworthy 
I hope to win a degree in agriculture 
A degree Agriculture 
But not too much Hey hey hey 
And you 
You going too 
No sir 
Now then that's talk enough take the money home 
My ignorant daughter 
A beautiful girl 
Oh she has a wretched appearance 
Now you 2 might mix your blood in one bowl 
Oh but your daughter is much too good for my son 
Oh but I couldn't presume to look so high 
It's impossible Quite impossible 
But it might done 
I should think of it night and day good bye 
Ah What a beautiful day 
It seems to draw me inspite of myself 
I'm not used to these places 
Eh I have no clothes 
I'm only a farmer 
I have work to do 
Work Work 
You must learn to enjoy yourself 
And girls who do these things elegantly 
Watch 
That must be the stairway 
Yes shall we see what it feels like 
No no no 
No I've never been off the ground all my life 
She's like a dream person 
Stop it Stop it Stop it 
Quiet 
I told the thing not to wake me till this time 
Another feast 
The dragon feast woman 
It's my duty to observe the old customs 
My nephew insisted on it 
Old customs indeed 
There's more than that with your nephew 
But the rich man may have 2 wives 
Of course 
Well What is it What is it 
Well And that is not as strange as you think 
I just tell your mother I wish to see her 
Yes father can you spare me a moment 
Why trouble me about it 
Prepare the seed my son gives you 
These flowers are dead Little One 
Your sister knows only happiness 
Mother Is it a letter from your brother 
No mother Father wishes to see you 
Oh Forgot how chilly it was 
Are you well 
Your pain is it bad 
No it's nothing 
You sent for me 
Well there's a thing I've done 
I bought the Great House 
The house of Loo 
Courts and land 
I'm the new lord there 
Well Have you no thanks 
Our sons were born here 
They must have wives 
You must make yourself becoming to it 
Look at your hair Your clothes 
You disgrace me 
Wear the pearl you have 
The pearls I have them 
You would never wear them 
Why I look at them sometimes 
I need them give them to me 
I know that I'm ugly and not to be loved 
All that we have now came from you 
That is the truth and I say it 
But but now 
But now 
There's a woman not such a one as you; 
not as good as you it's like a sickness 
When I'm with her it's not enough 
When I'm not with her there's nothing 
Even the land is nothing 
Then it will be better when she's in your house 
You'll say that 
Is it your wish 
Yes 
Let it be then 
Ou lang what is there more to say 
Nothing 
Who is it 
Nothing 
Who is that man going out the gate 
He look something like my son Lung 
Now then what 
I'm Ching the farmer 
Well Ching the farmer what 
I have business with Wong the farmer 
Wong the farmer 
This is the great house of Wong 
He's the lord here 
There's a bad woman in the house 
There's a bad woman in the house 
Bad woman 
Father hush 
It's his second wife 
I say it's a bad woman 
Come father it's he and his second wife 
I'm tired I want my tea 
But what can I do 
Where can I walk in the evening 
But the money 
Then it's money that you love 
No no Little Flower 
But it will not be easy until the harvest 
But these're few little things 
If you love me if I please you 
It shall be done Anything Anything 
Becareful My pearls 
I may come in 
Does my music disturb you 
Oh no No I like it 
I listen sometimes 
I play it because I'm lonely 
I'm sorry I'm very sorry 
If you'll please I must go 
Then you'll pass by the shops 
Yes 
Would you mind giving him these for a bottle 
With silver 
Why um yes Yes 
But you won't misunderstand 
Why should I 
When a woman gives her slipper to a man 
But I shouldn't tell you 
Oh no please 
Well then it means he's taking her fancy 
But you ask me to have it guilded 
Of course mother 
Now then we'll hear what our scholar has to say 
First I am ashamed of my ignorance 
But I am not ashamed to inquire of my teachers 
What does he say 
He says he's learning many things to help us 
But is he happy there 
Does he say he need anything 
No mother 
I miss my beloved father and mother deeply 
Mother I want to go away too 
Go away 
To the wars I'll be a soldier 
Now then what madness is this 
And I'll go 
I wish she'll stop that music 
Now this house is full of silences 
Would you like to hear it 
If he's well it can wait 
But there's more in your face than the letter 
He'll be a soldier 
A soldier 
But I'm nothing in this house 
Help Ching until the harvest 
Put an alert on yourself 
That's good for any man 
Now all these stuff I don't know 
He's come to the age of tempers and weeping 
When I was a lad I had no such tempers 
You worked on the land; 
but he's like a young lord 
And he's been alone here 
And you worry his age to have a bride 
But I was given a sla 
My marriage cost my father nothing 
The boy's our son 
What 
You're dreaming 
Even she hears it who has nothing else; 
Enough 
Gossip Kitchen gossip 
That's where you came from 
Where you wished to live live there then 
Nothing 
The man is loon here 
What are you doing in the house 
There's work to be done in the fields 
But what is it 
But why do you weep 
There's food for everyday 
And fire 
Sometimes a man gets a longing for his fields 
No it's better for my son to come; 
in the house he pulls against the yolk 
He has all the freedom here he wants 
Where is he today 
He comes and goes 
Sometimes 1 day sometimes 2 
I thought you knew 
I knew nothing 
I spend my time in town 
Why don't you tell me you slow witted ox 
For weeks 
What 
Well speak 
If you have eyes and ears you'll know 
Know Know what 
That the second wife and your son is 
Liar 
Get off my land 
Well it's been a long time with us 
Take what belongs to you and go 
I came to you with nothing 
I'll go with nothing 
Good day master Good day 
Ah Father 
Get out Out of my sight 
Good bye mother 
Mother you're ill you should have a doctor 
It's nothing 
Where you go you ought to tell me 
They say there's a war in the north 
Sometimes in wars there are those who die 
Well if that's best let it be 
I will see to it 
If you must go there's a thing to be done 
Speak to your father 
No no I can't 
You're his youngest son 
Father father 
I am going away 
But go 
Nephew We're ruined Everything's gone 
And I predicted it I predicted it 
What's happened

What is it 
I forgive everybody 
What is it 
This 
Locusts 
The flying plague 
Well Let them come 
But the lion the harvest 
What can we do against the gods 
It's not the gods 
It's a thing of nature We can fight it 
Have you ever seen a plague of locusts 
No but 
I have They came in millions 
The air is black with them and stinky 
And where they come down there's nothing left 
Not a green of wheat Not a blade of grass 
Not a leave nor flower Nothing 
And can you fight that with your book 
Forgive me 
And I heard this: 
We can fight these creeping things 
This thing can be done 
Show us how to do it 
If it'd please you come on to the fields 
I saw it As a boy They came down there 
And they were gone with a change of wind 
But the crops were gone with them 
But that's the thing 
We can hold them off till the wind changes 
We must take a fire break along these hill tops 
Make a wall of fire 
But my wheat lights on fire in a fire wall 
And mine And mine And mine 
I'll pay for what is eaten and what is burnt 
We'll get kerosene bring it in carts 
The fire stuff it makes a quick high flame 
We can fight everything behind this wall 
a wall of water 
It will fail 
If it fails we'll fight them with torches 
With noise With our hands 
It can't be done It must be done 
All you have and all I have depends on it 
You think I'm rich 
But if I lose this harvest there's nothing 
If I save anything I'll share it 
Yeah yeah yeah

Liquor kills Liquor drives you crazy 
The squadron leader drinks it 
Staff officer division 
Do you know this photo Mr Maréchal 
Sure Ricord took it with me 
And where can I find Mr Ricord 
On leave Of course 
This gray smudge worries me 
Here just below the road 
Such unanimity honors our aerial cameras 
It was a foggy day 
I'd like to resolve this enigma 
I'll request a plane 
I'll go get ready sir 
Flying suit or fur jacket 
Get me the fighter squadron 
Take a car to the sugar refinery 
If they're Officers invite them for lunch 
Three bottles of Moselle 
Two officers

Lt Maréchal pilot 
My apologies 
My officers 
I am honored to have French guests 
Now gentlemen let us eat 
Orderly coats 
May I serve you 
My cousin Edmond de Boeldieu 
He was military attaché 
He's a fighter pilot now 
Aren't you eating 
I can't cut the meat 
May I 
Please do 
You speak good French 
I was a mechanic in Lyons 
No kidding 
Me too I'm a mecha 
From the Officers ofthe German 21st Squadron 
I'm sorry about this coincidence 
May the earth lie lightly on our valiant enemy 
Read these gentlemen the camp regulations 
Incorrect dress is not permitted 
It is forbidden to speak to the sentries 
Russian nouns are declined just like in Latin 
Newcomers Let's warn them 
Angel of purity angel of light 
Hide your valuables 
What are they singing 
To hide our valuables 
Don't touch Those belong to me 
I've got nothing old man 
Had I known I'd have brought some cash 
This conduct is unbecoming 
Sorry it's our duty to search you This is war 
I perfectly agree but conduct it courteously 
If not I'll see your commanding officer 
Here Müller have some chocolate 
You've no right to open my ham 
It's in the regulations I read them carefully 
It's rotten You can have it 
He's hard to please 
I'm delighted when my folks send a parcel 
Is it all right 
He told me so 
He'd much rather lay into your peas 
Don't kid yourselves 
If they did that our parcels would stop coming 
They're short of food for themselves 
Hurry our guests will be hungry 
This tastes like an old sock 
What do they feed the French 
Cabbage but they have their parcels 
And the Russians 
Cabbage roots but no parcels 
And the English 
Ever see me 
Theater's too deep for me 
I prefer bicycling 
You follow the Tour de France 
Can we purchase what we like 
Yes through the canteen 
You won't fiind those 
There you go sir I'll come again tomorrow 
Gentlemen time to eat 
Sir 
So gentlemen what shall we begin with 
Chicken foie gras or Captain Cook mackerel 
You're well provisioned 
Don't they feed us here 
Oh please 
A cognac to start with sir 
I've never eaten so well in my life 
Some fish 
I'm getting used to Rosenthal's kindness 
Man is such an adaptable creature 
You can see he's a professor 
Profess her Confess her 
Address her undress her 
Oops a slip 
You're quite a joker 
Is that supposed to be witty 
He's hard to please 
Let's drink to peace 
Not bad this cognac 
Comes from Fouquet's in mouthwash bottles 
Fouquet's 
It's a bar on the Champs Elysées 
Been to Paris lately 
Last week 
Lucky man Places crowded 
Maxim's was packed 
I never go to places like that 
I prefer a nice little bar 
Maxim's don't know it either 
It's no great loss 
We know you eat at your brother in law's 
He never lets up 
Is he there Mr Monocle 
No he's not 
I've just been to the canteen 
It's about his armchair request 
Let him tighten his belt 
I'll tell him 
He's nice the guy with the parcels Well off 
And how 
You know the Rosenthal bank 
His parents 
Am I tickling you 
And what's he do 
Runs a big fashion house 
Funny 
With his money I wouldn't 
What do you do in civilian life 
I'm a engineer for the cadaster 
can we trust your pal the Captain 
He may seem strange but he's okay 
You can trust him all right 
It's all right then Why 
You see after dark 
we're digging a tunnel 
What for 
To escape 
What do you dig with 
A coal shovel old food cans 
That's slow work 
We've been at it for two months 
just a few more weeks 
The war'll be over fiirst 
You're deluding yourself 
Think so 
Best to be prepared 
Where's the tunnel 
You'll see tonight after roll call 
So you're digging a hole 
Like Monte Cristo What a laugh 
Mind if I ask you something 
Go ahead 
Maréchal Present 
Cartier Here we go again 
Good night Arthur 
Whose turn is it 
Cartier's 
What's that for 
For breathing These are to extend the line 
And the bags 
For removing earth 
This is the alarm 
If I start to suffocate I yank on the string 
The can falls 
And the boys pull me out by the feet 
The feet 
What are you waiting for 
Watch me play the mole mol asses 
Is the tunnel safe 
It's shored up with wood from the theater 
And the earth 
Stuffed under the floorboards 
But there's not an inch of space left 
Hear that 
I'm sure I heard something 
It's nothing 
Listen 
We'll send someone out to check 
I'll pretend to go to the latrine 
Say Arthur what happened 
The fellow tried to escape 
We opened fire 
Behind the buildings 
Is he dead 
I think so 
And you what are you doing out 
Going to the latrine 
What was it 
Someone tried to escape 
A sentry shot him 
He's dead 
The alarm 
No answer Pull him out 
Hurt bad 
Drink some cognac 
From Fouquet's 
Here's mud in your eye Don't drop the bottle 
Who goes down tomorrow 
You do sir if you don't mind 
Good news 
What do you think 
Up for some gardening 
I hate the way German bulletins exaggerate 
And our papers don't 
Remember the Russian steamroller 
Isn't it time we got down to serious business 
Sure but not all at once 
And that famous General Winter 
And do you remember Turpinite 
They even tried it on a flock of sheep 
Too bad they didn't stop at that 
What're you guys planting 
Dandelions 
I'm dreaming of dandelion salad 
The war'll be over before your dandelions grow 
The trunks are here 
The costumes 
At the theater 
There should be a trunk with women's clothes 
Coming sir 
Playing patience 
Exactly I'm a realist 
Find anything Arthur 
Nothing 
Well gentlemen enjoy yourselves 
Where will we put all this 
I asked for hangers 
Be careful 
Looks like a little girl's dress 
Dresses are short now 
just below the knee 
So I hear 
I'd love to see that 
Then put it on 
Not him he never shaves 
We have to take inventory 
The corset too 
Take it easy 
Short hair 
It's like sleeping with a boy 
When we're not around women act foolish 
I'm sure my wife hasn't cut her hair 
How would you know with that mug 
Shoes How small they are 
Stockings 
Stockings of sheerest silk 
Hey fellas I'm ready 
Let us dream a bit first 
You'll only stifle our imagination 
Look at that 
Black stockings 
Looks like a real girl 
Funny huh 
Doesn't it look funny 
Yeah sure looks funny 
Poor boys 
Enjoy yourselves 
Out there children play soldier 
In here soldiers play like children 
I wish I knew what's going on back home 
No news 
Nothing 
I don't care what my missus is up to 
I want out 'cause I'm bored stiff bored 
Right 
For me it's the spirit of contradiction 
They won't let me flight so I'm dying to 
For me it's simple 
A prison camp is for escaping 
And you Rosenthal the sportsman 
Him 
He was born in Jerusalem 
Old Celtic aristocracy 
If that's not worth escaping to fight for 
I got into the war in a funny way 
I became a soldier because I'm a vegetarian 
The doctor warned us against eating meat 
I turned vegetarian and got well 
Or stop my wife from cheating on me 
You have to admit it's stirring 
I loathe fifes 
Still it gets to you 
It's not the music that gets to you 
It's the marching feet 
Thanks to your dumb talk I ruined my pants 
FORT DOUAUMONT TAKEN 
What about our show 
Do we still put it on 
You bet we do All the more reason 
In fact we should invite the German Officers 
Stop the show Stop the show 
Stop fellas 
A little hole to escape 
GERMAN TROOPS RECAPTURE DOUAUMONT 
Isn't that awful 
Can't be much left of it 
I want to see some light 
It stinks of shit in here Hear me 
It stinks of shit 
And I want to hear a voice 
I want to hear a French voice 
What was he yelling about 
The war's too long 
That's a lot of dirt 
There's more than one woman on earth 
Not for me 
That's why she cheats on you 
One thing upsets me: leaving Maréchal behind 
It weighs on me as well 
In fact it disturbs me 
But that's war No room for sentiment 
Glad to seeyou old man 
We are too Wait until you hear why 
You old dog 
Got anything to eat 
I'm hungry 
What time is it 
11 o'clock 
Time's dragging today 
So we meet in Amsterdam 
I'm keen to see Holland for the tulips 
What about the cheese 
Don'tyou like Dutch cheese 
You have the instincts of a shop girl 
Assembly at three o'clock 
All Officers are to change camps 
Get your things ready 
Gentlemen I wish you a pleasant journey 
I hope you will see your wives again soon 
We ought to alert them 
About the tunnel 
Open the window It stinks in here 
We can't get any gloves here 
Try to make them last 
Yes sir More coffee sir 
At least it warms my insides 
The list of new prisoners sir 
Three new officer POWs reporting sir 
But I'm sorry to see you here 
We feel the same 
Sit down gentlemen 
No thank you sir 
As you wish 
One must lower oneself at times 
I understand 
Lieutenant Maréchal five attempts at escape: 
Disguised as a chimney sweep 
Correction sir: heating engineer 
Amusing very amusing 
But less so when an NCO tried to pick me up 
That I didn't like 
Indeed 
I assure you 
But the situation is completely different here 
No one escapes from this fortress 
You understand me don't you 
So as not to be accused of German barbarism 
I have decided to apply French regulations 
Look them over 
They make good bedtime reading 
And now gentlemen if you will follow me 
Oswald My coat 
We have 25 more guns like this one 
I suppose you know the Maxim gun 
Very well sir 
But I prefer the restaurant 
12th century 
Excuse me sir 
Are we your only boarders 
Your comrades are back there 
1 3th century 
A 1 20 foot drop 
So kind of you to show us around the grounds 
It's such a nice castle sir 
It's so old 
And so cheerful 
Sorry I can't give you a room to yourself 
I'm touched but I'd never have accepted 
I hope our walk didn't weary you too much 
Not at all sir we're fline 
14th century Pure Gothic 
Ifyou don't mind gentlemen 
Not old Rosenthal He wasn't any luckier 
The commandant has put you all in the same room 
That way you'll eat better 
That's very nice of him 
A mere formality 
A friend of my mother's Quite respectable 
She did charity work 
In good society it's usually the pox 
Like so many others 
Everything is popularized 
How about intellectuals 
With us it's tuberculosis 
Here's Mr Pindar 
And the middle class 
Liver and intestinal ailments 
Your dictionaries are in myway 
A lamentable oversight I'm so sorry 
Not that I care but who's this guy Pindar 
More than you the war my life 
Pindar is the greatest Greek poet 
The greatest Greek poet 
You don't say 
There My map'sjust about finished 
200 miles No kidding 
There My picture's finished 
Justice Pursuing Crime 
It came out all right 
Look to reach this Constance place 
Will it hold 
It can hold 10 of you and 5 like me 
They're searching the rooms 
Under the mattress quick 
No under mine 
That won't do 
It's childish 
May I 
Now there's an idea 
A convenient little gutter 
Here they are 
Gentlemen inspection 
Louise wrote to Victor: 
I am as weary as a girl after 22 nights oflove 
22 nights oflove imagine that 
Continue 
Not that corner 
You have my word 
But why my word and not theirs 
The word of a 
Rosenthal and a Maréchal 
It's as good as ours 
Perhaps 
No not that 
It's very rare 
They really are stupid 
Everything go all right in here 
Not bad For us too 
He's doing well He's very happy 
He lost an arm and married a rich woman 
A truly fine career 
Recognize her 
Sit down 
Let me tell you something 
That's being harsh 
I used to be a combatant 
Now I'm a bureaucrat a policeman 
But it's the only way 
I can still appear to be serving my fatherland 
My spine is fractured in two places 
A silver plate 
In my kneecap too 
I owe these riches to the misfortunes ofwar 
May I ask you a question Of course 
But my comrades are Officers as well 
A Maréchal and a Rosenthal Officers 
They're fine soldiers 
Charming legacy of the French Revolution 
Neither you nor I can stop the march of time 
We're no longer needed 
Isn't that a pity 
Perhaps 
I admire the way you tend your geranium 
Nothing grows here but ivy and nettles 
I'm glad I'm leaving with you 
With us 
With him 
I never really feel at ease 
Different backgrounds 
There's a wall between us 
He's a terrifiic guy 
Sure and he's on the level but 
Suppose you and I were on the skids 
We'd just be two bums 
That's all vanity 
I'm really proud to come from a rich family 
Inviting you to my table is myway ofshowing it 
Most people think we're stingy 
Wrong We're often generous 
Unfortunately along with that quality 
Jehovah gave us an overdose of pride 
To hell with Jehovah 
All I know is you've been a real pal 
Please come and share it with us 
From the Czarina 
Must be caviar 
Vodka 
Lead on 
Now we can pay you back for all your kindness 
The Czarina is always good hearted 
Quite a lady your Czarina 
Think of what's in store 
Principles ofAlgebra 
Elementary Ethics Grammar 
A cook book 
Something to sink your teeth into 
What a farce 
Let's go before something happens 
Goodbye thanks anyway 
You have no right to burn books 
It's crazy sending us books 
The sentries are busy with the Russians 
It's a long drop here but it's unguarded 
If only we'd been ready What a chance 
Especially at night We'll try again 
It was kind ofthem to hold a rehearsal for us 
Too risky You're exaggerating 
It would amuse me 
When do you want to go 
Why us 
You're in it too 
Why not 
Don't you trust us 
That wouldn't stop me Well then 
A plan like yours can only work with two men 
And I know your preference 
It's not fair What's fair in war 
We can't accept that 
I'm not asking you 
I'm telling you 
The arts aren't forbidden here 
You like music 
So so I like a good waltz 
I love the flute 
Here's the program: We buy flutes for everyone 
That's when night falls 
Five minutes later they confiiscate our flutes 
At 5:1 5 another concert with anything at hand: 
Result: assembly in the courtyard 
Then what 
That's my concern 
Come now Yes awful 
I'd like to say something 
Pour some warm water over my gloves will you 
Whatever happens I want you to know that 
I'm not doing this for you personally 
So we needn't get mawkish 
Go on 
But there are times in life 
Let's avoid them shall we 
Excuse me 
So you'll be wearing those 
Any objections 
To each his own style 
You can't do anything like other people 
I'm the same with my mother and my wife 
In that case 
No doubt about it: gloves tobacco 
We've got nothing in common 
I was a teacher back home 
I advise you not to start again 
We'll do just that in 15 minutes 
Order executed sir 
You see 
It worked 
Put them on bread and water for three days 
And no parcels 
Ready boys 
Two seconds 
Assembly 
I understand my students now What a lark 
While it lasts 
Well 
What 
Goodbye 
Listen 
I beg you Come down 
Lieutenants Maréchal and Rosenthal have escaped 
So that's why 
Search lights 
Send out patrols with dogs 
Alert all military and civil authorities 
Report back to me every quarter hour 
Your orders have been carried out sir 
No sign of the fugitives yet 
Forgive me 
I would have done the same 
French or German duty is duty 
Are you in pain 
I aimed at your legs 
It was 500 feet with poor visibility 
Besides I was running 
Please no excuses 
I was clumsy 
I'm not the one to be pitied 
For me it will all be over soon 
But you'll have to carry on 
Carry on a futile existence 
For a commoner dying in a war is a tragedy 
But for you and me it's a good way out 
I missed my chance 
You shouldn't be talking so much 
Sir 
We should've avoided the road 
We couldn't sleep in the reeds 
He's gone 
Didn't you see it was a woman 
Let's get going Wait till dark 
I'm freezing I have to move 
Want your sugar 
There's not much left

You poor thing You ate your buttons too 
Does it show 
So we're not waiting till dark 
No we'll skirt the village fiirst 
Your foot hurt 
It's nothing a nerve 
Let's go

You and your foot 
It's not my fault I slipped 
You slipped That's all I hear 
We're out offood Might as well give up now 
Gladly 
I've had enough too Had enough ofme 
Well the feeling's mutual 
You're a dead weight a ball and chain 
I never could stomach Jews 
You said it 
Get lost I'm sick ofyour ugly mug 
I'm going You're on your own now So long 
So long Go ahead 
I'm so happy I could sing 
There once was a little steamboat 
After five or six weeks at sea

Why'd you come back 
Come on

There's only a small couch in the living room 
Oh well never mind what we thought

Well Bark 
Maybe it'll work out all right 
Sure 
Of course

Oh George I am willing to do my part 
No roof is big enough for two families 
I'm sorry 
Goodbye 
Satisfied 
Incidentally who are we going out with tonight 
My mother 
But that's different 
Mother just won't fit in at all will she 
No 
I don't see how we could 
Oh hello Mother 
It's Mother 
It's only because you'd be bored 
Well don't you worry about me 
They'd think you were ashamed of me Ho ho 
George was only trying to be kind to you dear 
My bridge pupils drive him mad 
Oh Pa's picture 
You gonna put it in here 
Aw that's fine 
Another day has gone by and no word from him 
Do you suppose he's all right 
Of course he's all right 
We'd hear fast enough if he were ill 
Well I guess that's true 
Is uh my tuxedo laid out 
Yes 
I couldn't find your shirt 
Did you send it to the laundry 
No 
I did 
But Mother 
I took it to the laundry around the corner 
Yes but we 
These people do lovely work 
Well I didn't know that 
I know you like to look after George 
Yes 
Well so do I 
Of course 
Oh well I only wanted to help 
Of course 
And you're so busy playing bridge 
I don't play bridge I teach bridge 
I guess I'm not much help around here 
I could make the sandwiches couldn't I 
They're coming from the delicatessen 
It's cheaper to make 'em at home 
I know 
But we couldn't do so well 
These are going to be fancy 
How fancy can a sandwich be 
You'll see 
It requires more strength 
How do you do 
Uh suppose we play them 
I'll bid one spade 
One spade 
One spade 
Two hearts 
Do you play cards 
Well maybe a little hearts 
I used to play a lot with my husband 
I always gave him the Queen of Spades 
We called her Dirty Dora 
Say by the way that's a good heart hand 
And you haven't got Dora 
Let's see who has 
Oh You 
Well aren't you 
Uh huh 
Oh that's no fair 
And anyway she likes the company here 
Well maybe I can fix that 
Do you think it's all right if she goes alone 
Oh I should say not 
That's what I thought 
Would you go with her 
Or would that be too much of a responsibility 
What a load off my mind 
Will you tell Rhoda 
Why certainly 
Thank you dear 
Yeah 
Well is it sad in any place 
Some of 'em cry when his dog dies 
Thanks

Well what do you want 
I want a stick of gum 
Take it from the counter 
I'm proud of mine too 
They leave me alone 
They don't need me and I don't need them

Anyway my children would have a fit 
So let them have a fit 
What difference does it make 
Mr Rubens I uh 
I wonder if you'd do me a favour 
Sure Why not 
Uh it's from my wife 
Is that a favour Mr Cooper 
Ready 
Uh huh 
Thursday night 
Dear Bark I've been thinking of you all day 
It seems like yesterday he was born 
I hate to give in and sound so weak 
and this is just between us two 
So Nellie took me there to meet her 
Nellie kept saying how lovely the place was 
so I guess she really thought it was nice 
I guess those places must be terrible 
Go ahead 
Her doctor wants her to have a complete change 
Nellie said Europe 
She's very worried not about herself but 
But I told Nellie her health comes first 
Oh Bark dear 
I love you so that 
Mama 
Sarah 
So what do you want 
I just wanted to look at you Mama 
To look at me 
Yes Mama 
I wanted to make sure you were here 
I 
I broke my glasses this morning

Next lecture at half past Tuesday 
Well I won't be pickin' on you much longer 
Have you got some kind of a plan Grandma 
Well I haven't but your grandpa has 
What's the matter 
Why kid yourself Grandma 
You know he can't get a job 
He's he's much too old 
That's just fooling yourself 
Why don't you face facts Grandma 
Oh Rhoda 
But when you're 70 
Grandma 
I I didn't mean to 
Oh I I know honey 
Why don't you try to relax 
You'll wear yourself to a frazzle 
But she could telephone or something 
Don't you see 
Something terrible must have happened 
I know Rhoda so well 
She must have met with an accident 
Hello 
Yes 
This is Mrs Cooper 
What 
Don't talk so fast 
You don't want me 
Uh hello 
It was for you 
Well why didn't you let me talk 
She hung up 
She called about Rhoda 
What did she say 
How is she Oh uh 
I'll tell you 
Oh dear 
Well I just got to talk about it 
Told me what 
You didn't know 
Why didn't you tell me then 
Well I promised Rhoda 
You promised Rhoda 
Rhoda promised that she'd never 
What Rhoda promised is beside the point 
She's my child not yours 
Well you were so busy with your 
Oh I'm so busy with my bridge and things 
I thought we'd get to that sooner or later 
If it's anybody's fault I know who to blame 
I'm going to tell you 
You like to entertain them 
You raised five children of your own 
You might let me raise one 
But you've got to butt in 
You've got to 
Anita 
I'm sorry 
I know how you feel 
I'll be glad when you go back to work 
I wish your mother was here 
You've only got a little cold 
What's the good of worrying Mother 
Oh Who on earth's that 
Well it must be the doctor 
Good heavens 
He got here quick enough 
No but 
Wait a minute 
Come on 
Huh 
Come on 
All right 
Good morning Doctor 
Good morning Mr Payne 
Who's ill 
This way Doctor 
Here he is 
Hm So this is the patient 
He's shivering 
I uh 
I wouldn't let him do that 
No 
Ha ha Well we'll uh 
We'll have a look at him 
When a man's sick he don't want a 
How long have you been practising' 
Oh for several uh 
That is for some time now 
How did you come to take it up 
Why didn't you get his father 
I'm sick 
Put that thermometer back in your mouth 
Cora 
Excuse me Doctor 
You think we ought to send for your mother 
I'm kind of sorry for him 
So am I but we haven't got room 
Once we got 'em both we've got 'em 
George would try and talk us into keeping 'em 
Nellie's run out on her 
Yeah 
What about Addie 
What about her 
It's only a little over a hundred 
Now we'll do a little listening 
Hm 
Sit up please 
I suppose I'll get pneumonia now 
That's it 
Hm Ooh That thing is cold as ice 
Take a deep breath 
Say 99 
What for 
That can't cure a cold 
Father behave yourself and say 99 
Darned if I will 
I'd feel foolish 
You mustn't mind him Doctor 
That's quite all right 
Come on Mr Cooper say 99 
And I never had to say that number 
All right 
Now we'll listen to your heart 
Yeah 
I didn't say it 
Yes 
What do you want 
Excuse me 
My name is Max Rubens 
I have the paper store down on Graham Street 
We have a boy who delivers 'em 
I I wasn't trying to do business 
But it is always a good idea huh 
You're Cora no 
Yes 
Your father speaks of you 
It's on account of him I come like this 
I heard he was sick 
A slight cold 
It's nothin' 
Oh Could I see him 
The doctor don't want him to have any visitors 
Visitors would upset him 
Certainly they won't hurt him 
All right 
If the doctor says so 
Go ahead 
Thank you 
Right in there 
What's the matter Doctor 
Nothing to be alarmed about Mrs Payne 
I'm sorry 
About his cold 
This winter weather and everything 
I 
I felt sure you'd say that Doctor 
It certainly is wonderful soup Mr Rubens 
Sure 
Yeah I can feel it warming me all over 
Sure it's wonderful 
Hm Just like me she wants you to get well 
Yeah 
That's nice of her 
Now if somebody would only call up my wife 
You know how it is 
Now I've got to fix your mustard plaster 
Mm 
What are you eating 
Some soup Mrs Rubens made for me 
Wasn't that nice 
That's fine isn't it 
Mm 
You bet it is 
Hm 
Don't eat it 
How do I know what's in it 
There's nothing in that soup but good chicken 
Mm hm 
When my Sarah makes 
Your Sarah can mind her own business 
I cook for my father 
Oh 
Don't put any more of that in your stomach 
Yeah 
I'm afraid it's all gone Cora 
You mean you ate all this mess 
Mrs Payne for myself I don't care 
Goodbye Mr Cooper 
Goodbye 
And thanks for coming 
And thanks for the 
Thanks 
What's the matter with you 
Nothing 
Will you please stop worrying Mother 
Oh I can't 
But Cora said his temperature is normal tonight 
But it may be up again tomorrow 
Anyway your father doesn't like his doctor 
Look Mother his temperature is normal tonight 
But it may be up again tomorrow 
Isn't this where we came in 
Shut up 
Mother will you please stop borrowing trouble 
Oh dear 
I guess I'll go see how Anita is 
Uh no no no 
I'd better go Mother Hm 
Now stop it honey 
You're just going to make yourself ill 
I can't seem to help it 
Everything is going to be all right 
It's you that I'm worried about 
Gosh I never saw you give in so completely 
But everything's gone wrong 
What's Mother got to do with it 
Well didn't she tell you that I 
What are we going to do 
I don't know 
I don't know 
I know 
She's got to have them again George 
She's got to 
Don't you see 
What happened today is just a sample 
She'll be leaving us next 
Oh no no 
Oh yes she will 
She'll get a job and an apartment of her own 
Those things happen don't they 
And we're helpless to stop it 
I know 
I I know 
Maybe 
What dear 
Hm Oh nothing 
Nothing 
Did I awaken you Grandma 
It doesn't matter 
Is there any mail 
I think so 
Hello Ma 
Hi 
Rhoda 
I spoke to your father today George 
He told me that he's perfectly well again 
Yes 
We've got to keep him well Mother 
He's going out there to live 
Just for a little while for his health dear 
Oh of course 
I want him to be well 
There isn't anything I 
Cora thought that Addie would take you both 
Addie says she can't 
As long as she takes Father that's enough 
He'll be leaving soon 
I guess so 
Maybe I'll be able to see him to say goodbye 
Oh Of course 
Mother 
There's something else I've got to tell you 
Let me do it while I can 
You tell me later 
Well it's only this 
Well it's a fine place 
I'd meet friends my own age and 
But Mother I didn't 
No now let me finish dear 
I see that it'll never turn out that way 
So I want to go to the home 
Well I'm glad that's over 
Oh there's just one more thing dear 
He's funny about things you know 
He's a little old fashioned Father is 
Those places seem terrible to him 
He must never know that I'm going 
This is one thing that has to be handled my way 
Yes Mother 
You can always forward my letters 
It'll 
It'll seem mighty funny 
Oh well 
You were always my favourite child 
Well that's that 
Take it easy there 
Oh come in Mamie 
Thank you 
You going down to meet the bus huh 
Mm hm 
And won't you be glad to see your husband 
Yes indeed 
and to thank you for everything 
Oh thank you Mrs Cooper 
But there's nothing to thank me for 
Oh I know 
Yes ma'am 
They even give me the afternoon off 
In fact I'm going right now to meet my husband 
So am I 
Yeah 
Will you stop lookin' at your watch 
We've got five whole hours 
We mustn't even think about the time 
I guess you're right Lucy 
The trouble is I was a failure 
I won't let you call yourself a failure Bark 
You don't sow wheat and reap ashes Pa 
Oh come on 
Let's get out of here 
Excuse me a minute Ma 
I want to get something 
I'll be right out 
Come on Pa 
They didn't have my size 
Uh huh 
Fine time to tell us 
Hm 
Do you see the old couple out there 
Uh huh

Of course you don't know me from Adam's father 
Of course the car sells itself 
I don't expect we'll get to ride in it 
Well why not 
Have you a little time right now 
How about it 
Oh well we couldn't 
We're having dinner with our children 
Well but I can take you there Oh no 
You needn't bother about that 
A ride up the drive perhaps 
Oh we couldn't Bark 
Why not 
Now that's the proper spirit 
Come on Let's go 
Well 
Pretty nice isn't it Bark 
Yes indeed 
Are you warm enough Uh huh 
Are you 
Oh yes I'm very comfortable 
Say 
Weldon 
Say this is awful nice of you Mr Weldon 
That's nothing Mr Cooper 
You know we really 
Of course I remember 
It doesn't matter Bark 
I had the children 
I'm ashamed of myself Lucy 
We went to the theatre twice I remember 
Uh three times 
Oh so we did 
In a handsome cab 
Mm 
On a Thursday 
No that was Wednesday 
I can remember too 
Yeah 
Never mind 
Do you remember going to the museum 
Of course I do 
You do not 
You never went 
You said you didn't like museums 
I wonder if the Hotel Vogard is still standing 
It'd do you good 
Oh no Bark 
We couldn't 
Why not 
Who's to stop us 
Well the children are 
Mr Weldon 
I certainly can Mr Cooper 
He's gonna take us 
How do you like this car's performance 
Isn't it smooth 
Oh it's perfect Mr Weldon 
Thanks 
Have we Ma 
My it's nice to see it again 
Yeah 
How about the car 
Oh it's fine 
In buying one 
Well why not 
A car's no longer a luxury 
It's uh it's a necessity 
Oh I'm so sorry we took your time 
I didn't have anything to do 
I uh 
I just wanted to show the car off 
Oh well that makes me feel better 
Thank you and goodbye 
You're more than welcome 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
We we didn't touch anything anyway 
May I have your coat 
Thank you 
Did you see what I did 
Yes dear 
I never was so embarrassed in all my life 
Thank you 
Oh I better get a cheque right here 
Could I have a cheque please 
Oh you won't need one I'll remember you 
Oh thank you 
You're strangers here aren't you 
Well not exactly 
We spent our honeymoon here 50 years ago

Ladies are drinking here

Say that's all right 
Are you sure there's no calls for me 
OK 
Well that's funny 
No it isn't 
I don't care about the roast 
I'm worried about Father and Mother 
I wonder where they can be 
Some fun huh 
Ah yes indeed 
Not at all 
The hotel's friends are my friends 
You know ladies never used to 
The aquarium uh was Wednesday

Without the mumps 
Well the point is that we were married 
Yeah we were married all right

That's not the point at all 
Oh well that was Thursday 
I'm sure it must have been Mrs Cooper 
I wonder if you'll excuse me now 
Now you shouldn't have done that 
It was my pleasure 
Thank you Mr Norton 
Was it Wednesday

Let me hear you say this

Oh well you go right ahead 
I kind of like to dawdle 
Are you having a good time Lucy 
Oh yes Bark 
Not really 
She's a grandmother too 
Oh Well that I just can't believe 
It's kind of hard for me to believe 
Fifty years go by pretty fast 
Only when you're happy 
How many children have you 
Five of 'em 
Really 
I'll bet they've brought you a lot of pleasure 
I'll bet you haven't any children

Oh that's very nice 
Yes it was 
Best thing I ever did marrying her 
Oh Bark 
Will you stop that 
He was He proposed to you didn't he 
Yes he did but you don't have to tell it 
Randy Dunlap's the banker in our town 
Really 
I got his girl but he's got my house 
You do go on 
Yeah 
Next time don't stay away so long 
Goodbye Mr Norton 
Mrs Cooper 
I guess I'd have to be a bachelor 
Oh shucks Bark 
There are plenty of mighty pretty girls 
Not as pretty as you 
And you know what 
Bark you're sweet 
So are you 
You know your favourite 
Mm hm 
I think he must have got a peek into our future 
Or did the bank get that too 
Is she afraid Thought the man of the maid 
Are you afraid said the man to the maid 
She raised her eyes and spoke at last 
My dear she said the die is cast 
Into the future we'll travel alone 
With you said the maid I'm not afraid 
Would you like to dance Bark 
Huh 
It's a waltz 
Good evening everybody 
It's nine o'clock 
It's now nine o'clock and is everybody happy 
Smile and the world smiles with you folks

No I don't think so 
Well we ought to be getting to the station 
How much time have we got 
About a minute and a half 
What 
Well two minutes maybe 
Two minutes 
Why on earth didn't you tell us 
That wasn't a very nice thing to do George 
I think so 
I kind of thought they'd like to be alone 
Aren't we 
You're tellin' us right brother 
Right here 
Well I 
I guess this is it 
It looks like a very nice train 
Uh huh 
I hear they serve very good food on trains 
Well you'll very likely see her soon yourself 
I don't doubt that Bark 
You'll get a job 
Of course you will 
All aboard 
They didn't give us much time did they 
Goodbye Lucy dear 
Goodbye darling 
In case I don't see you again 
What 
Well anything might happen 
The train could jump off the track 
And in case I don't see you a

Every bit of it 
The whole 50 years 
Oh thank you Lucy 
All aboard 
Get going Pa 
Speak 
Let me see thy face 
What wouldst thou know my Queen 
Famed is thy beauty Majesty 
But hold a lovely maid I see 
Rags cannot hide her gentle grace 
Alas she is more fair than thee 
Alas for her 
Reveal her name 
Lips red as the rose 
Hair black as ebony 
Skin white as snow 
Snow White 
Want to know a secret 
Promise not to tell 
We are standing by a wishing well 
Make a wish into the well 
That's all you have to do 
And if you hear it echoing 
Your wish will soon come true 
I'm wishing I'm wishing 
For the one I love to find me 
To find me 
Today Today 
I'm hoping I'm hoping 
He'll say He'll say 
Ah ah ah ah ahh 
I'm wishing I'm wishing 
For the one I love 
To find me To find me 
Today Today 
Oh Hello 
Oh Did I frighten you 
Wait Wait please 
Don't run away 
Now that I've found you 
Hear what I have to say 
One song 
I have but one song 
One song only for you 
One heart tenderly beating 
Ever entreating 
One love 
That has possessed me 
One love 
Thrilling me through 
One song 
My heart keeps singing 
Of one love 
Only for you 
Take her far into the forest 
Yes Your Majesty 
But Your Majesty the little Princess 
Silence 
You know the penalty if you fail 
Yes Your Majesty 
One song I have but one song 
Hello there What's the matter 
Where's your mama and papa 
Why I believe you're lost 
Oh please don't cry 
Come on Perk up 
Won't you smile for me 
That's better 
Your mama and papa can't be far 
There they are 
Can you fly

Forgive me I beg of Your Highness forgive me 
I don't understand She's mad Jealous of you 
But But who

In the woods 
Anywhere Never come back 
Now go Go

Hide 
Oh 
Please don't run away I won't hurt you 
I'm awfully sorry 
I didn't mean to frighten you 
But you don't know what I've been through 
And all because I was afraid 
I'm so ashamed of the fuss I've made 
What do you do when things go wrong 
Oh You sing a song 
Ah ah ah ah ahh 
Ah ah ah ah ahh 
Ah ah ah ah ahh 
Ah ah ah ah ahh 
With a smile and a song 
Life is just like a bright sunny day 
Your cares fade away 
And your heart is young 
With a smile and a song 
All the world seems to waken anew 
Rejoicing with you as the song is sung 
There's no use in grumbling 
When raindrops come tumbling 
Remember you're the one 
Who can fill the world with sunshine 
When you smile and you sing 
Everything is in tune and it's spring 
And life flows along 
With a smile and a song 
Everything's going to be all right 
But I do need a place to sleep at night 
I can't sleep in the ground like you 
Or in a tree the way you do 
Maybe you know where I can stay 
In the woods somewhere 
You do 
Will you take me there 
Oh it's adorable 
Just like a doll's house 
I like it here 
It's dark inside 
Guess there's no one home 
Hello 
May I come in 
Shh 
Oh 
What a cute little chair 
A pickax A stocking too 
And a shoe 
And look cobwebs everywhere 
My my my 
What a pile of dirty dishes 
And just look at that broom 
Why they've never swept this room 
You'd think their mother would 
Maybe they have no mother 
Then they're orphans 
That's too bad 
I know We'll clean the house and surprise them 
Then maybe they'll let me stay 
Now you wash the dishes 
You tidy up the room 
You clean the fireplace And I'll use the broom 
Just whistle while you work 
And cheerfully together we can tidy up the place 
So hum a merry tune 
And as you sweep the room 
Imagine that the broom is someone that you love 
And soon you'll find you're dancing to the tune 
Oh no no no no 
Put them in the tub 
When hearts are high the time will fly 
So whistle while you work 
Uh uh uh uh 
Not under the rug 
So whistle while you work 
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig 
In our mine the whole day through 
It ain't no trick to get rich quick 
If ya dig dig dig with a shovel or a pick 
In a mine In a mine 
In a mine In a mine 
Where a million diamonds Shine 
We dig dig dig dig dig dig dig 
From early morn 'til night 
We dig diamonds by the score 
A thousand rubies Sometimes more 
Though we don't know what we dig 'em for 
We dig dig dig a dig dig

The heart of a pig 
Then I've been tricked 
The heart of a pig 
The blundering fool 
Mummy Dust to make me old 
To shroud my clothes the black of night 
To age my voice an old hag's cackle 
To whiten my hair a scream of fright 
A blast of wind to fan my hate 
A thunderbolt to mix it well 
Now begin thy magic spell 
Look 
My hands 
My voice 
My voice 
A perfect disguise 
What shall it be 
Ah 
A poisoned apple 
Sleeping Death 
One taste of the Poisoned Apple

Some day when my dreams 
Come true 
Christine 
Don't shout I tell you Don't shout 
Listen to me Why won't you listen 
You're a liar A liar You lied when you met me 
That's enough of it 
I'm nothing of the sort 
You're my wife 
Well what about it 
What do you mean 
Don't be a fool That boy is not 
A liar A liar 
Why won't you listen 
Because I'm not an idiot 
You quit me eight years ago to go on the screen 
Go on say it say it 
Christine 
Is she drowned 
No she's a mermaid 
Keep back please 
Now then which of you found the body first 
I did 
No he didn't 
We did 
Both of you 
Elsa saw it first 
That's right 
But he says he did 
Well he didn't 
Contradict the evidence eh 
Don't be silly 
Well just a moment if you don't mind 
Now miss what's your tale 
Well we were both going down to bathe 
And just as we got 
We saw this young man running away 
It's absurd I was running to get home 
That's right 
Nonsense the girl's hysterical 
I'm not I'm not hysterical 
You were running away you know you were 
You see I didn't see the belt 
I was only there a few minutes 
This woman has only been dead a few minutes 
Well it's time we got this thing finished 
Now is this belt yours or isn't it 
For the hundredth time I tell you it isn't 
How do you know it isn't 
Don't put down got put had a raincoat 
Which you've lost 
No not lost which I had stolen 
Why are you trying to distort everything I say 
Well I can't remember 
When I came back it was gone 
You mean it just went into thin air 
What sort of a place was this 
A common shelter called Tom's Hat 
All right we'll let that go 
Now did you know the dead woman well 
Yes fairly well I knew her in America 
Mr Kent means her lover 
It would be unfair 
Oh put down what you like 
Were you good enough friends to discuss money 
I received money from her on former occasions 
More than that it would be practically true 
What's happened to him 
He passed out or pretended to 
Of course he's passed out I've been told that 
What's that for 
To put under his head of course 
Give me a hand 
Go and get some brandy 
Could you do that to detective's ears as well 
No I got this from a boxer's dressing room 
Brings them round like fun 
A bit painful isn't 
Give me the brandy I'll do it 
You'll be all right in a minute 
What have you been doing to him 
Is he guilty 
No idea yet 
He doesn't look like a criminal 
Don't let the looks influence you young lady 
I don't 
Anyway he's not my type at all 
What the hell has happened 
You passed out 
Well that was something very much like it 
Don't worry you'll be all right 
I must go and find my father 
He seems to like the brandy 
He will probably go again 
Next time throw a bucket of water on him 
Who's that 
She's Chief Constable's daughter 
She's got a nerve 
She certainly has 
Hello father 
The proceeding has been quite formal 
Scotland Yard may have their own methods sir 
Is there someone decent to represent him 
I think they've got Mr Briggs sir 
Don't talk nonsense Inspector 
Well there was no one else sir 
All right Where have you been 
I've been snooping around 
Get them yourself 
Well ordinarily I would 
Come on 
Come on 
Try and give it some brandy 
Good morning 
Good morning 
I'm Briggs Lovely morning 
It does one good to see the sun doesn't it 
Nice of her 
Wasn't it 
Mostly affiliation orders and things like that 
Wouldn't it be a good thing to talk it over 
The trial 
Oh I'm afraid so 
Oh dear dear dear 
Well now where was I 
Oh yes Yes Well now 
Well it doesn't look too good does it 
However we mustn't be depressed about it 
Now take this point 
Those two girls that saw you running away 
Why were you running away 
I wasn't 
No Well it certainly looked very like it 
Like the money that poor dead creature left you 
That's going to be hard to explain away too 
Oh now I should be very much happier 
Oh dear me that belt 
I swear it was stolen at Tom's Hat 
You lost your hat too 
Oh no 
Oh well that's something 
Oh yes that's quite a good point Or isn't it 
Are you representing the police by any chance 
Oh yes sir Two pounds and three schillings 
Certainly how much 
Well I thought perhaps a couple of pounds 
Oh thank you 
Counselling costs a great deal you know 
Your case next Mr Briggs 
Oh dear 
Oh dear me I just mislaid my glasses 
You know I'm quite lost without them 
I shan't be able to read my notes 
Yes yes well we needn't go into that 
Oh no sir but I don't him to carry on 
Aye I will sir Maybe I were a bit hasty 
No that'll do 
Next case please 
Come straight home 
I'm off to see an old pal 
Hold it 
Look here this is the wrong man 
The prisoner has escaped 
The prisoner has escaped 
Your Worship I 
Come on you lot Run down the street 
Look for a murderer in a spinning 
Not me 
You're not afraid are you 
No but I'm not a fool 
Well take two others with you 
Here you two 
And you with the spectacles 
One each side of the fence and one up the road 
Sergeant take this car and go to the station 
There's a train leaving in a quarter of an hour 
Make sure he's not on it 
Yes sir 
Right sir 
Can you drive it 
I can drive everything sir 
Oh but 
All right Erica the Sergeant will do it 
Yes but the thing to do is to pull this 
All right miss you leave it to us 
Sometimes these get a bit cold 
What's this string doing here 
Crank up again 
It's all right I stopped 
I thought you must have miss 
It wasn't very uphill 
What about you miss 
Halt young man 
For what 
We've got to commandeer you 
You're going to what 
Use your car in the name of the law 
You can't do that it isn't a Black Maria 
It is for the moment 
We've got to get to the railway station quickly 
I can't go quickly the pigs don't like it 
We can't hold back we're on a job 
Pigs is my job 
I hope you will be all right miss 
Don't worry I hope you'll find him 
Now then where do we sit 
With the pigs 
Go on jump up 
Can't you give us a bit more room 
Carts don't take more than ten pigs 
Come on 
Well if it isn't Florence Nightingale 
What are you doing here 
You must be mad don't you remember who I am 
I don't think that's very funny 
And so am I for that matter 
What do you mean old crock 
There's one thing you should do 
What 
Thank me for pushing the car Thank you 
Two 
Two gallons please 
Ginger Two gallons 
Heard about the escaped man 
He's wanted by the police 
It's good for business 
I certainly will 
Oi dad Dad oi 
Thanks 
How much 
Two and eleven 
Anywhere you like 
Will you give it a swing please 
All right I'll do it 
How far is it to Tom's Hat 
How far would that be 
Oh about five miles I reckon 
Then turn right Go along a mile 
The right fork would take you back to town 
Did you hear that my dear 
Yes I heard 
You know I can't possibly 
Don't forget it's my petrol 
Straight down that road it's about five miles 
Yes thank you I heard 
This isn't Tom's Hat 
Will you please get out 
Why 
Because it's my car 
It's the best thing you can do 
So I've won you over 
You certainly have not 
Not a thing 
I feel like Bonnie Prince Charlie 
You must be Flora MacDonald 
A little while ago I was Florence Nightingale 
That's what I like about you you're different 
How can you joke about this 
Don't you know what it means if you're caught 
I'd make a rough guess Horribly rough 
Well it isn't funny you see 
No but I can laugh because I'm innocent 
You don't believe that do you 
I wish you did 
Well what are you going to do 
For what we're about to receive 
Let the Lord make us truly thankful 
O K 
O K 
It ought to be said in Latin really 
Did you go to the dentist's this morning 
Yes dad 
It hurt 
No fear look 
Oh it is a big hole isn't it 
That didn't hurt I hardly felt anything 
You know I don't mind going to the dentist's 
You were jolly white at breakfast 
I wasn't 
Yes you were 
You were walking like a jellyfish 
Let's have a look 
Big isn't it 
I may even bleed 
Stanley be quiet 
Chris you might lend me your gun after lunch 
I want it for myself old boy 
Top of the class 
Don't tease him you two 
He does speak English 
Highly dangerous 
Oh shut up 
Now that is English 
Chris can't shoot straight anyway Can't I 
What about this 
Christopher don't be disgusting 
It's a jolly fine one 
Take it away Chris and go wash your hands 
I washed them before lunch 
Do as I tell you 
O K 
Sergeant tells me you ran out of petrol Erica 
Yes I I had to push it for miles 
Haven't they caught him yet 
No not yet 
It's only a matter of time of course 
Of course my dear Watson 
Is your tooth all right Stanley 
Shall I have your potatoes mashed with milk 
It's all right don't fuss Erica 
It really depends how much money he has 
That's often a big factor in cases like this 
A big what 
Factor 
Never heard of him 
Richard 
How much did he have on him 
Oh the police think about three schillings 
Did you wash your hands Christopher 
Yes Erica 
Then sit down and get on with your lunch 
Do as I tell you Christopher 
O K Guns are the best things for rats 
Christopher don't talk so much 
What's the matter with you 
Nothing 
Food of course 
I know that I meant what kind of food 
Sausages 
The best thing would be chocolate 
It has very good staying power 
Then I'm afraid he would be very hungry 
And that of course may force him to come back 
With rooks pecking at his eyes 
Inspector Marsh is on the phone for you 
Perhaps there's some news 
Yes Inspector No news at all 
Well there must be some sort of clue 
Yes I see Oh dear me 
All right I'll come along quickly 
Let me know if anything turns up 
Yes Goodbye 
Have they caught him yet 
No not yet 
That don't say much of our police force 
They want some young blood don't they father 
What do you mean young blood 
I shouldn't be too surprised 
I don't think he's got much chance though 
Excuse me I shall be here in a minute 
All the roads are circled Can't last long 
It's jolly exciting isn't it 
Looking for these 
So you came back after all 
You really do think I'm innocent 
Hello what's that 
Food 
I 
I really don't know 
Goodbye 
Seriously I'm very grateful 
You mind if I eat 
No table 
It isn't that at all I 
I just forgot it 
There you are you see 
You don't believe I'm a murderer 
Now where was I Oh yes 
Then I shall be cleared 
Did you 
What were you going to say 
No nothing it doesn't matter 
No go on what were you going to say 
Did you know Christine Clay very well 
No I met her in Hollywood 
Beyond that 
See that 
What 
A bit of paper coming out of the old mill 
Someone's in there 
Perhaps it's 
Yes Come on 
Is that your dog 
Yes why 
What's it barking for 
Well he wants dinner I suppose 
Grab hold of him 
Me 
Yes get on with it 
What if he bites me 
In the course of duty you might get a stripe 
Go on grab hold of that dog 
It's all right leave him alone and come inside 
Anyone up there 
No 
All right Sergeant no one up there 
Are you sure 
Oh I couldn't see no one 
Did you look 
Of course I did 
I'm going to make sure 
Haven't you got no confidence in me Sergeant 
None at all 
Don't let them see you 
Where are we going 
Don't ask questions pull that string 
Come here Stop In the name of the law 
It's all right he's keeping up 
If you don't stop I'll jump out 
I've got the sun in my eyes 
What has the man at the petrol pump said 
A mile across then take the left fork 
Our troubles 
Your troubles you mean 
Can't you realize what you've done 
I'm on their side 
I'll find out all I can about the coat 
I might as well see if it's true now 
You'd better hide behind it 
A cup of tea and a piece of cake please 
Take a seat 
Don't you have lots of it 
I thought lorries were very popular 
Is yours that lorry out there 
I've always wanted to drive one of those 
Let me see now a coat 
No I'm wrong miss you'll never find that coat 
Don't remember 
He had a raincoat that was nearly new 
Leave old Will alone 
Your coat You're quite right it was stolen

To save your conscience eh 
Yes if you like 
This may be useful 
What's that for 
For getting in touch with old Will 
You mean he doesn't do night work 
I shouldn't think so 
Well we can do without it then

The look on your face 
We mustn't laugh it's very serious 
Of course I don't want to make trouble

Yes we'll be there but what then 
Are you sure the tramp will be there 
Will it be as easy as all that

I've traced you for nearly fifty miles 
Fifty miles what for

Well there's a Boulevard three mile off 
We'll go Erica 
Let's try the old mine workings

Really 
I see 
I don't know 
And he said nothing at all 
Nothing at all 
Will you please try and make them easy for me 
Then why don't you 
We're doing our best 
You find a clue and follow it to death 
The evidence against him is very strong 
It's not Can't you tell he didn't do it 
He had no reason to do it 
That woman was helping him he told you that 
Yes he told us a lot of things 
Because 
Because he's innocent 
Why he's the finest person 
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting gentleman 
O K 
Come in 
Come in Erica my dear 
I wanted us to have a little talk together 
That might help us to find this fellow 
No father there's nothing 
I see 
He's not a murderer 
And I'm responsible 
You'd better read this 
Must you do this father 
Is everything all right 
Has Old Will found him 
I'm going to give myself out 
That's why I came back 
And to say goodbye 
I did it because I wanted to 
It's no use 
I suppose they found it in the car 
No belt in the pocket by any chance 
I've got to go Old Will's waiting 
Will you go now 
I don't want it 
Erica 
Those matches Did you say Grand Hotel

What sort of twitch has he 
Just in one eye 
No both eyes 
Can't we go to another table

I want you old man 
Don't come in again like that 
We mustn't give up

I take as many as I want 
All right all right 
Come on boys time's up 
The whole thing's beyond me Please go in 
I'm sorry sir but it can't be helped

News has come from Vienna 
You intend to act on your plans 
What better moment than this Sir Guy 
If he returns 
And I'll see to it that he doesn't 
I'll assign tax districts to you tomorrow 
Tomorrow Your Highness 
But who's gonna pay me 
Pay Pay 
That's all you Saxons think about 
Stop 
Stop 
This man is freeborn He's a landowner 
You can't make a slave of him 
But I protest 
Dickon follow me 
The rest remain here 
What's your name you Saxon dog 
A better one than yours 
What's your name 
Much the miller's son 
It's death to kill the king's deer 
And death from hunger if I don't 
Be quiet you 
I won't be quiet 
You can beat and starve us Saxons now 
What the devil 
Come now Sir Guy 
You'd not kill a man for telling the truth 
lf it amused me yes 
Be thankful my humor's of a different sort 
By what right do you interfere with justice 
By a better right than you have to misuse it 
That goes for your master Prince John 
Thank you He does need a bit of a talking to 
Eh Will 
He has been getting rather out of hand 
Fetch him along 
Hold there What's his fault 
He's killed a royal deer 
You're wrong 
I killed that deer 
This man's my servant 
Whether for serf or noble 
Really 
Are there no exceptions 
Thanks good master 
Better look before you shoot next time 
Take me as your servant 
I ask no pay Just to follow you 
Fetch the deer then 
Hail to Prince John 
Was it worthwhile coming with me from London 
Must I take him Your Highness 
Why you like him don't you 
Well he's a Norman of course 
Is that the only reason for liking him 
Oh nay I'd not force you my lady 
Perhaps when I know him better 
Of course 
You're a very wise young woman 
Objections Your Highness 
Well said sir knight But not too many mind 
There's one exception I'd make Your Highness 
A certain Saxon noble 
Who is that 
Sir Rob 
And you didn't take him 
That would have been a problem Your Highness 
A Saxon a problem 
He's a notorious troublemaker my lady 
Aye An impudent reckless rogue 
I could have captured him long ago but 
But what 
I'll not tolerate 
Open the door

You wouldn't dare 
Sit down 
insteadofto ransomthe king 
But a strange thing happened 
You speak of loyalty Yes 
Why not 
You wouldn't dream of keeping it yourselves 
Friends 
What shall we do with this treasure 
Divide it amongst ourselves 
Hold it for Richard 
It belongs to the king 
I may have been hasty 
But why you a knight 
Or are you afraid of the truth 
Or of me perhaps 
I'm afraid of nothing 
Least of all of you 
Good 
Then come with me 
Oh so you are afraid 
Well men 
Hi 
May we be worthy Robin 
You are mother you are 
Have you eaten well friend 
Yes thank you Robin Hood 
We humbly thank you master 
Just simple villagers who never harmed a soul 
And now 
But you've taken Norman lives 
You're a strange man 
Strange 
Because I can feel for beaten helpless people 
And one of those men was a Norman 
Norman or Saxon What's that matter 
What's your reward for all this 
Reward 
You just don't understand do you 
I'm sorry 
I do begin to see a little now 
If you do then that's reward enough 
Come Lady Marian 
My life 
Peter Harold

With your permission my lady 
Goodbye my lady 
Goodbye 
He took everything you had collected 
Every silver penny 
Oh we resisted as well as we could 
Where are your wounds 
Your bruises 
And where are your men 
What did Your Highness expect 
That fellow's got to be taken Understand 
lf I may be so bold as to inquire 
You couldn't capture him 
You mind your words 
Arrows 
He said shooting arrows at a crow 
Take that silly looking bonnet off 
But what 
We'll outwit him 
We'll hold an archery tournament 
Archery tour 
That's marvelous 
He's the finest archer in the North 
We'll give a prize Say a golden arrow 
And ask him to risk his neck for that 
What do you mean 
Yes yes I noticed 
Well then 
Well then how do we get word to him 
Get word to Robin 
But even if he comes won't he be disguised 
Will you take that bonnet off 
You hope 
Oh it will if he's here 
Are your men sure of their orders 
Yes 
You talk as if this were a trap 
The winning team will meet all comers 
You know it's a trap 
A golden arrow from the lady herself 
They've cooked this up to take you 
Well what of it 
You know what'll happen if they do 
Where's your sporting blood 
It'd be ruder to get your neck stretched 
Where's your love of fights risk adventure 
We'll have to see him through 
Prepare final flight 
Does my lady find it interesting Lady Marian 
Oh I'm sorry 
I asked if you found it interesting 
Yes very They're splendid archers 
You'll find it much more interesting later on 
The winning team will compete as individuals 
Captain Phillip of Arras 
Elwyn the Welshman Matt of Sleaford 
They now challenge all comers 
Remaining archers will use center target 
Matt of Sleaford out 
Elwyn the Welshman out 
The tall tinker 
Now is the time 
But he could 
Have your men close in if you wish 
Look 
Phillip of Arras shoots next 
Tie You will be allowed another flight 
Another 20 paces 
I'll wager 1 00 marks on Phillip of Arras 
He split Phillip's arrow 
The tinker wins He wins

What's to prevent your killing me if 
Is there no one here with sense enough to see 
One moment 
I swear good Father 
Have you thought of a way 
Yes 
Can you get us in the castle That's no good 
He's heavily guarded 
But I thought of another way Listen

You gentlemen have traveled far 
Yes quite a distance 
I'm sorry I can't give you better food 
There is little left to us these days 
This will be enough 
The inn at Luton was well supplied How is that 
That's a Norman inn 
But it's an outrage 
I'll complain to Prince John 
Strip my person of jewels 
Who's he 
The Bishop of the Black Canons 
Do you wish to go on after dinner 
No 
We can't reach the abbey tonight 
I'll stay Tend to the horses 
Yes Your Grace 
Bring food to us 
Yes Your Grace at once 
What happened Your Grace 
I told you 
We've been robbed 
Who did 
Why Robin Hood of course 
There's no other with impudence enough 
Robin Hood again sire 
You've heard of him then 
Oh he seems well known hereabouts 
Oh then you're strange to this shire 
More or less 
What might be your names gentlemen 
Landlord where's our ale 
Coming sirs 
Will you gentlemen be remaining here tonight 
Your Grace is too kind 
Thank you Good night 
The window 
Are there beds prepared landlord 
Let's to sleep then I'm tired 
I'm afraid he suspects sire 
I fear so 
I ought never to have left England 
I noticed when Robin Hood's name is mentioned 
The mysterious outlaw whom we have sought 
Which gives me an idea 
And you're sure it was Richard 
No doubt of it 
How like my dear brother this is 
But Richard has no army 
No Your Highness 
lf he had we should have heard of it 
lf my brother happened to be killed 
England would have a new king 
That would be murder I'll have no part 
Your Highness I beg of you 
Go on Gisbourne Who's to 
oversomelittlemischance 
You don't love my brother I hear 
I have little reason to Your Highness 
You know this tavern 
Yes 
If Richard dies 
Dickon returns to the roll of English knights 
Am I not right 
When shall I start 
Now How many men will you need 
I shall do it better alone Your Highness 
The sooner you're crowned king 
The better for my friends 
You're a clever fellow Gisbourne 
Thank you Your Majesty 
hereinNottingham the day after tomorrow 
Do you suppose she heard 
I don't know 
Take this note to Much at Saracen's Head 
My lady's hearing is a little defective tonight 
You seem upset 
Upset 
Why should I be 
Let's be frank with one another 
I don't see the need 
You're charming but not exactly clever 
Oh no no no Please don't trouble to deny it 
Am I not right 
Why how could I warn Richard 
That's ridiculous 
When Richard's in danger what more natural 
And you do intend to warn him don't you 
Don't you 
No 
Guard 
Escort my Lady Marian to the Great Hall 
Are you not ashamed my Lady Marian 
Yes I am 
Bitterly 
At first I wouldn't believe 
againstbeasts who were drunk on human blood 
And now you intend to murder your own brother 
You'll be sorry you interfered 
Sorry 
I'd do it again if you kill me for it 
You wouldn't dare 
You are quite right my dear

The best in England

What do you mean 
Suppose you went to the chair yellow 
Yellow 
Say what's the matter with you 
You've been worrying about my courage 
I know that 
This is a different kind of courage Rocky

Not the courage of heroics and bravado 
The kind that you and I and God know about 
I don't know what you mean 
Soapy and several of the others 
You can well imagine what they told me 
Tell him not to be afraid 
Well what do you want 
I'm not gonna let them down 
They've gotta despise your memory 
They've got to be ashamed of you 
You and I will know you're not 
You ask a nice little favor Jerry

There's one thing I know I really know 
Do you realize the fight you want to take on 
I can't help you

What security have you got

Thank you Father Hello Dave 
Hello I came over as soon as I could 
What's up 
Now look Eddie just what do you want 
Dave it's grand to see you 
It's been a wonderful year for both of us 
Did you pay all your bills last month 
Yes sure Most of them 
That's what I was afraid of 
No Dave that isn't why I wanted to see you 
I'm a busy man 
A little drive in the country will relax you 
Just what you need Just what we both need 
Bye Father Flanagan Goodbye boys 
Now remember what I told you 
Lovely country isn't it 
Over 200 acres here of rich fine soil 
You could really live and breathe out here 
What about it 
I want to buy it 
We could build a real town for the boys here 
Mortgages and bills and debts Be reasonable 
With this place you'd be looking for 100 boys 
500 All right 500 What 
How you going to get the money 
How you going to do it 
It's crazy 
Well maybe you're right 
What did you say 
Maybe you're right 
Eddie don't you feel well 
Stop it 
How many acres 
Over 200 
I haven't been a bad risk so far have I 
The newspapers aren't friendly to you as it is 
What do you think they'll say about this 
I know 
What do you suggest 
Hargraves 
And he's a tough nut to crack 
That's fair Dave 
All right here you are It's a bargain 
Thank you You're welcome 
We haven't met before but I know of you 
Well that shortens preliminaries 
Can I help you 
Do you want to 
Well that's all right 
But why do you go out of your way to hurt me 
For yourself too 
I can do the same with 500 
You know better than that 
Do I Father Flanagan 
Surely you must know you above all men 
That's pretty stiff Father 
What little I've done I've done on nothing 
Look at this 
Court will sentence him to life in prison 
You'll admit that won't you 
So he took a gun and killed him 
Temporary insanity 
But an 11 year old: Just a savage 
What do you want of me 
I want your help for homeless boys 
No I'm afraid I can't do that Why not 
The very foundation is false 
No such thing as a bad boy 
I've seen you do that You lead public opinion 
On my convictions 
You want me to throw them out the window 
This poor kid in prison for life 
A town for boys governed by boys 
It's worth a shot isn't it 
Your sincerity is worth a shot 
But understand when you fail 
Fair enough 
There we are Dave 
No but the day will come Dave 
It might not be as bad as that 
Now Eddie come on 
Now where are you going 
Yes and you're in for life too 
Thank you 
Goodbye Mo Goodbye Father 
Have a nice trip Father Thank you 
Goodbye boys Bye Father 
Pee Wee 
Are you going to be a good boy while I'm away 
Can I get my candy when you're away 
Goodbye boys Bye Father 
Nice trip Bye Father

There must be some mistake 
No mistake 
How do you do Mr Applegate 
How do you do again 
Thank you 
You don't need to That's all right 
I understand 
Strange young man isn't he 
Is he suffering from something 
He's had a nervous breakdown 
Had or has 
Had 
It's left him sort of 
You know 
My my what a pity 
And so young too 
Is that so 
You're all right though 
I hope so 
Have a drink Thank you 
I don't know what you mean 
He's a hunter like yourself You don't say 
Then Elizabeth you've come to the right man 
Mr Bone Isn't that amazing 
I didn't tell you to think up a name like Bone 
Shut the door What's the matter 
Baby would eat George That's what I mean 
But I was ready for him 
Have you ever been 
Pardon me So sorry 
Have you ever been in Arabia Mr Bone 
I said Have you ever been in Arabia 
No 
Tibet perhaps No 
Excuse me 
At least that got a rise out of him 
He 
The poor 
I've never been there 
You've never 
Well no matter 
Excuse me 
Give me patience 
No this is too much I can't stand it 
My soup is gone It was cold 
Digging trenches Blaming it on an innocent dog 
Nothing but a heap of nonsense 
Enough to drive a man crazy 
And then they say Keep away from the bottle 
Don't drink 
If one more thing happens I'll quit 
A doctor chasing after a dog 
Just picture it 
Good gracious what was that 
That was a loon Elizabeth 
L O O N yes 
You didn't 
Are you quite sure that was a loon 
Yes indeed 
I've heard many a loon 
And if there ever was a loon that is a loon 
Isn't it Mr Bone 
No 
Well what do you say it was 
A leopard 
Don't be ridiculous 
Now you take the rogue elephant for instance 
Excuse me Major 
You're right It is a loon 
Thank you 
Yes I know 
You know 
Thank you 
Of course it varies at different seasons 
Let me see now what month is this 
June 
June It would go something like this 
I'll just prepare for it 
Now let me see 
There we have it 
Pardon me It's still a loon 
I'm slightly out of voice 
Try again Yes I shall 
Now I didn't do that 
It was probably an echo 
It was a long time coming back wasn't it 
Try again I shall 
There That's better 
That's peculiar 
Yes No 
Why do you say yes You see 
Pardon me 
Excuse me 
All right but you'll be sorry 
I can't stand it I've got to get away from it 
And then they say Gogarty you mustn't drink 
The bottle 
I'm within my rights 
I'm perfectly within my 
Hannah 
Hannah Gogarty 
Me gun 
What would you be wanting of a gun now 
Hand me my gun 
Be quiet both of you 
I saw it outside Saw what 
Clean up this mess And serve the next course 
Do you realize what's happened Baby's escaped 
I don't care We've got to catch him 
Right now Don't 
All right I'll go with you 
Baby The door's open 
Is he there 
I don't know 
Nope he's gone 
Oh dear Now Aunt Elizabeth 
Don't lose your head 
My what 
Your head 
I've got my head 
I've lost my leopard Now wait a minute 
Nothing's gained by uncontrolled hysteria 
Compose yourself What should we do 
Come on 
Susan I hope this time you've come to stay 
Yes I've come to stay Aunty 
We've just been walking up and down 
Where's that young man going now 
He's just going in to take a rest 
He has to take frequent rests 
The doctor says 
Have you ever had jungle fever Major 
You have 
Then you realize how important rest is 
One says rest one says exercise 
Which do you prefer 
I think that perhaps 
Why Susan listen to this 
What 
This is a cable from Mark 
Mark Not a particle of sense in it 
What does it say 
Are you pleased with Baby 
Love Mark 
Mark And not a word about my leopard 
Your leopard 
I've always wanted a leopard Excuse me 
You know he promised Thank you very much 
Don't call the zoo 
I just called 
It's all fixed Call back and unfix it 
No questions call back 
I told them they could have the leopard 
You've given away Baby 
You have no right 
It's your fault 
You've ruined everything I've had enough 
I quit 
You can't quit 
Call them back 
But you said 
Everything's changed 
Just call back and say you were mistaken 
They'll never believe me I'll fix that 
I'll say you're a drug addict 
Hello operator 
Not so loud 
Get me Westlake 284 
I don't know Never mind David 
Hello 
Is that zoo Nobody's talking baby talk 
I'm the man that called up about the leopard 
Stop them What's the matter 
What did he say 
It's too late 
It was the night watchman 
You think 
How big a leopard 
We've got to catch him before they do 
Aunty we're taking George for a walk 
Where's the leash 
My goodness 
Where's George 
Where's George 
Why this morbid interest 
I've got to find him 
What for 
He knows where my intercostal clavicle is 
Your what 
I did But you didn't 
Where is he 
He's gone Gone where 
Out that door 
Why didn't you say so 
No not that door That door 
Thank you That's right 
I can't stand this another moment 
Come along 
Let's get some fresh air 
Yes 
Shall we run 
Yes 
There's something wrong 
Please the leopard's cry is entirely different 
It's done largely with the palate 
Why do you put your thumbs together 
Really it is You've got something there 
Got what 
The mating cry 
Now don't be rude Horace I'm not rude 
I didn't scream You didn't scream 
I certainly did not You didn't scream 
No 
I ought to know if I screamed 
Then there must be something wrong here 
Don't you think it's time we went inside 
No 
We've only just left it 
But don't you think it's a good idea to go back 
Why don't you sing David 
I can't 
You can 
It's not fair 
You're just being stubborn 
That's a dog George 
What's the matter 
Something moved in that bush 
Let me go first 
No 
You might get hurt 
Thank you David 
I can't see a thing Neither can I 
Susan where are you 
I'm not playing 
I'm caught on something Help me will you 
Help me will you 
No That's poison ivy 
I bet you wouldn't treat Miss Swallow this way 
I'll bet she knows poison ivy when she sees it 
Yes I bet poison ivy runs when it sees her 
I'm not here to discuss Miss Swallow 
I'm looking for George I'll find him if 
David are you all right 
Don't laugh I can't help it 
You look so silly 
Did you hear that 
That's Baby 
It's George too You don't suppose 
Shut up 
Look 
Look David they like each other 
Here George Come here 
No Susan be quiet 
Is there any way to cross this stream 
Surely it's shallow 
We can wade across Good 
The riverbed's changed 
Did we get across 
Now George and Baby have disappeared 
While I'm wet I'm gonna go to the other side 
Don't leave me 
Next time I'll try and arrange one 
Don't be so grouchy 
And I do so like being with you You do 
Well I like peace and quiet 
But it's peaceful and quiet here 
Your sock's on fire 
That's all right 
I don't care anymore 
That's fine 
Throw the other one in That's true 
You could have 
Don't be upset David 
Well who wouldn't be 
You told your aunt I was crazy didn't you

Man of the worldly mind 
Now do you believe in me 
I do I must 
But why 
Why do you trouble me 
You are bound in heavy chains 
I wear the chain I forged in life 
Is its pattern strange to you 
It must be a ponderous chain by now 
Jacob 
Old Jacob Marley 
have you no comfort for me None 
And none for myself 
You travel fast 
On the wings of the wind 
Captive bound and double ironed 
Poor and ignorant Scrooge 
Yet such was I 
Business 
Mankind was my business 
The common welfare was my business 
The hunger I could have satisfied 
Hear me 
My time is nearly gone 
If you must go Jacob don't let me keep you 
What is it 
You will be haunted by three spirits 
Is that the chance you mentioned Jacob 
It is 
I think I'd rather not 
Jacob 
Don't leave me yet 
Jacob 
Humbug 
Who are you 
I am the Ghost of Christmas Past 
The light 
It hurts my eyes 
It blinds me 
I'm not surprised 
I've never seen it before 
Of course not 
What's your business with me 
Your welfare Your reclamation 
Rise and walk with me 
Good heaven 
This is my old school 
I was a boy here 
Merry Christmas 
Harry Joe Tommy Percy and Dick 
Dick Wilkins 
These are but shadows of things that have been 
They have no consciousness of us You knew them 
I went to school with them all of them 
Your lip is trembling 
The cold 
Let's continue You remember this way 
Remember it 
I could walk it blindfold 
Strange to have forgotten it for so many years 
That is myself 
Was yourself 
Was 
What is that upon your cheek 
Nothing 
The cold 
Listen 
Goodbye young Scrooge 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas Jack 
Your parents coming for you 
Always do you know 
Father and I talked it over 
I say your governor must be a crusty old bird 
He knows what's best 
Jack hurry 
Good luck 
Merry Christmas 
Master Scrooge 
Yes sir 
Your sister's come to see you 
Ebbie dear Ebbie 
I've come to bring you home 
Home Fran

She loved you 
I believe she had children before she died 
One child 
Your nephew Fred 
Come 
You remember this place 
Ebenezer Dick 
Yes sir 
Yes sir 
Do you observe the time sir 
7:05 sir 
No more work tonight 
Christmas Eve Dick 
Christmas Ebenezer 
Up with the shutters Close up shop 
In the eye Dick 
Cheer up Ebenezer 
What a lark 
He always comes through doesn't he 
Closed up tight sirs 
Tight as a barrel sir 
Good Now about tomorrow 
It's a holiday of course 
Thank you sir 
Good night Ebenezer Good night Dick 
Good night sir 
And thank you sir 
Yes sir 
Thank you sir 
A sovereign 
A whole sovereign 
Solid gold through and through 
What is the matter 
Nothing particular 
Something I think 
Yes there is 
Yes he was But he's dead now 
Well 
You have a clerk Bob Cratchit 
Your clerk for instance 
Business is business 
I'm a good businessman 
My time grows short 
Your gradual enslavement to greed 
Your ruthlessness 
No leave me 
I can't stand more 
I can't stand more 
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present 
Have you never seen the like of me before 
Never 
I'm afraid I haven't Some 1 800 
A huge number 
A tremendous family to provide for 
What are we going to do 
Did you say walk or fly 
Touch my robe 
Merry Christmas to you 
These people what are they doing 
Now then watch who you're stepping on 
Watch who I'm stepping on 
I like that 
Go on off it 
I will not 
Why you little 
Here let's make it up 
Frightened 
I wouldn't touch your old hand I wouldn't 
Well you're not such a bad sort after all 
Thank you and a merry Christmas to you 
And the same to you 
Is there a peculiar flavor in what you sprinkle 
An excellent flavor 
Would it apply to any kind of dinner 
To a poor one most 
Why to a poor one most 
Because it needs it most 
I'll 
Stop shoving will you 
Stop it I say or I'll 
Here we are being silly aren't we now 
Like a couple of infants 
We stopped that 
Yes we did didn't we 
That church 
We have business there 
Come 
What makes you say that Spirit 
It is obvious that they love each other dearly 
Their love will soon fade 
I take exception to that 
On the contrary I think their love would grow 
I 
They 
They should be married 
Good morning and merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas to you

What was the matter with him 
Who knows 
Who cares 
What has he done with his money 
I haven't heard 
He hasn't left it to me 
That's all I know 
It's likely to be a very cheap funeral 
Suppose we form a party and volunteer 
I don't mind going if a lunch is provided 
I'll offer to go if anybody else will 
We used to stop and speak whenever we met 
Goodbye 
How are you

No time for it 
Business on my mind

The difficulties are considerable 
That is if uh nothing untoward occurs 
Uh yes 
Why you lied so deliberately a few minutes ago 
I lied Yes 
To those people in the corridor 
I heard every word you said 
Inquiry 
Just because a little woman can't be found 
That girl was making a fuss 
Why a scandal like that might lead anywhere 
Anywhere 
Yes I suppose it might 
Nobody 
Nobody 
She's as real as you are 
I saw her I think 
You did 
A little woman in tweeds 
Yes 
Wearing a three quarter coat 
With a scarf 
That's right 
I knew I was right 
But your husband said he hadn't seen her 
You win 
You know this calls for action 
Are you prepared to make a statement 
Of course If it helps Ah 
Pardon 
My patient has just arrived 
The most fascinating complication 
We've some news for you 
This lady actually saw Miss Froy So 
We're going to have the train searched 
It is not necessary 
My theory was a perfectly good one 
The facts were misleading 
I hope you will find your friend Excuse me 
I'll be in here if you want me 
Right you are 
Come along 
Eric 
What's that 
Have you taken leave of your senses 
On the contrary I've come to them 
What do you mean 
If there's a scandal there'd be a divorce 
You couldn't let me down could you 
You forget one very important thing Margaret 
Your husband would divorce you I've no doubt 
Signorina 
Down there they look for you 
Your friend 
She come back Come back

Yes I think so 
Then I must apologize 
You did meet her after all Then 
But not on this train 
But I didn't I couldn't have I tell you 
I talked to her here 
If this lady wouldn't mind Madame 
Bon 
What a gift for languages a fellow's got 
It isn't a bit like her is it 
Yes she's the woman 
Perfectly 
She isn't 
She isn't 
Well aren't you going to say anything 
You might at least gloat if nothing else 
What am I expected to say 
You only did it to save your own skin 
She was lying I saw it in her face 
They're all lying but why Why 
Now why don't you sit down and take it easy 
Must you follow me round like a pet dog Oh 
Good bye 
The doctor was right You're all right 
It didn't happen I know now 
I'm glad you're gonna take it like that 
What you want to do is to forget all about it 
Just make your mind a complete blank 
You know 
Watch me 
You can't go wrong 
Anything 
Well Do you think you can eat anything 
I could try 
That's the spirit 
You'Il feel a different girl tomorrow

You'Il never guess 
Harriman's Herbal Tea No wrong 
Double scotch 
A million Mexicans drink it 
Maybe they do but Father didn't 
Miss Froy gave the waiter a packet of it 
Packet of what 
But it's so real I'm sure it happened 
Did we or did we not 
We did 
Sorry 
Go on telling me about your father 
Well my father was a very remarkable man 
Did he play the clarionet 
Incessantly 
Why not 
It was all he left me 
You know you're remarkably attractive 
Has anyone ever told you 
We were discussing you 
Yes of course 
Um do you like me 
Not much 
Well after I'd uh paid my father's debts 
Would you like to buy a copy 
I'd love to 
When does it see the light of day 
Hmm about four years 
That's a very long time 
Very long book 
Do you know why you fascinate me 
Now what's the matter 
Look 
It's gone What's gone 
Miss Froy's name on the window 
You saw it You must have seen it 
She's on the train 
Now steady steady 
Excuse me Thank you 
It's okay No no We've got to find her 
Now Stop the train 
Some of you must have seen her 
They're hiding her somewhere 
I appeal to you all of you to stop the train

Leave me alone 
What 
She has What 
Vanished

It's done in India 
What 
The rope trick 
Oh that 
It never comes out in a photograph 
You need peace and rest Sorry 
Nothing doing 
Isn't there anything we can do

It will be best if you persuade her 
She likes you 
If you coat it with sugar she may swallow it 
Cosmopolitan train this 
People of all nations 
What's all the mystery 
You're right 
Trifle late aren't you 
She may be dead by now 
Well dead or 
We're going to search this train 
Look at that 
Hurry up 
Quickly 
Only that she was a governess going back home

Anyway there might be something down here 
What on earth 
Our Italian friend that 
I've got it 
Wait a minute 
There you are 
His visiting card Look 
What's it say 
will visit all the principal towns and cities 
Vanishing Lady 
Perhaps that's the explanation 
What 
Well perhaps it's a publicity stunt 
No I don't think so 
Well what's your theory 
Oh I don't know 
My theory 
I'll tell you 
Oh dear 
I can't get one 
That one Where are you 
I can't see you I'm about somewhere 
Here I am 
Where are you 
Ooh Oh Are you hurt 
Ouch Come on Out with it Oscar 
Not much Come sit down over here 
What is that thing 
You were about to tell me of your theory 
Oh my theory 
Well 
Ahem Oh Thank you very much 
Right 
Right 
Therefore they are deliberately lying 
Why 
I don't know 
I'm only Watson 
Because they daren't face an inquiry 
I told you that hours ago 
Oh yes So you did 
As what Well 
Old English gentleman 
They'd see through you 
Perhaps you're right Aha 
Will Hay for instance 
Now boys boys 
Which of you has stolen Miss Froy 
Own up Own up 
Those glasses give them to me 
Why 
You sure 
Yes they're exactly the same 
Gold rim with 
Where did you find these 
Well down here on the floor 
The glass is broken 
That's the last 
My spectacles please 
Yours 
Are you sure 
Ah naughty naughty 
That's the game is it 
Let's see about that 
Kick him See if he's got a false bottom 
Wait a minute I'Il get him up 
Ow That doesn't help 
Quick Pull his ears back 
That's it 
Look out He's got a knife 
I can't reach it Will you Well done 
We know how that thing works Come out of there 
Is he out do you think 
Anyway we've gotta hide him somewhere 
What's in here 
Hurry up quick before he comes to 
It's empty 
Bring him along 
Come on 
Oh no you don't 
Oh What's the matter 
Garlic 
I'll be all right in a minute 
Here Hold on to this Oh yes 
Let's tie him up Oh well 
We're getting somewhere at last 
That ought to keep him quiet until we find her 
Ah Hard work but worth it 
Uh let's have the evidence 
Evidence 
Yes the glasses You've got them 
No I haven't got them 
Oh He's got them 
He isn't there Well 
Snookered It's a false bottom 
That twister He's a contortionist 
He's gone all right 
We can't fight the whole train 
We need allies 
Yes but who can we trust 
Yes you're right 
He might help Come along 
Let's tell him the symptoms 
All right Oh wait a minute 
This is the one 
Oh He's not there 
Listen 
I've just had a particularly idiotic idea 
Oh yes Yes that's why it's an idiotic idea 
Come on Let's find the doctor No no no 
Wait a minute 
What is it 
Did you notice anything wrong about that nun 
No I don't think she's a nun at all 
They don't wear high heels 
Yes you're right 
Listen 
Did you see Madame Kummer get on the train 
The patient is Madame Kummer 
Perhaps it isn't a governess at all 
Perhaps it's some political thing you know 
Well let's investigate 
Can we take a look at your patient please 
Thank you 
Keep an eye on the nun 
What are you doing here 
Why are you in here 
This is the most serious accident case 
Are you out of your senses 
There is no face there 
Nothing but lumps of raw flesh 
What do you want me to do 
Murder my patient 
You're quite sure that this is your patient 
Miss Froy 
You can't be serious 
Whatever put such ideas into your heads 
I understand she's deaf and dumb 
I'Il be with you in a moment 
How the devil do I know how they cottoned on 
Somebody must have tipped them off 
You never said the old girl was English 
What difference does that make 
There's that girl again 
Seems to have recovered Lucky it blew over 
How do you know that it's not Miss Froy 
Oh 
Uh I want a green Chartreuse 
Won't you join me 
Oh thanks I'd like a large brandy 
And you 
Oh I don't want anything 
Oh come on It'Il do you good No really 
You're very tired It will pick you up 
All right then Just a small one 
Uh two brandies and a Chartreuse 
Nun No 
Oh is she 
Well that is rather rather curious isn't it 
It's a conspiracy 
That's all it can be 
She's off again 
Hope she doesn't create another scene 
He came along and grabbed the glasses 
Yeah We went for him and had a bit of a fight 
Oh a fight Mm hmm 
We knocked him out 
Here 
Well 
Oh I see 
Yes Just British diplomacy Doctor 
Yes 
Well what are we going to do 
Come on Wait a minute however 
But one moment 
Uh we mustn't act suspicious 
Behave as if nothing had happened 
Drink That'Il steady your nerves 
Let's go We must hurry now 
Come on Drink up 
Wait in here 
There you are 
Anything wrong 
However it makes no difference 
We shall reach Morsken in three minutes 
Quite an eventful journey 
Well 
Oh I should perhaps have explained 
The operation will be performed by me 
Hmm 
How shall I say melodramatic course 
But your persistent meddling made it necessary 
You all right 
You must have fainted 
Did I 
Listen 
Right 
Come on Let's get going 
It's locked 
We can't go that way We'd be spotted 
You can't do that 
Don't worry It's only next door 
Go on 
You needn't be afraid It is Miss Froy 
It's all right 
You haven't been drugged 
What the devil are you 
He said you were deaf and dumb 
Oh never mind about that now 
If you want to save her you've got to hurry 
Here No come on 
There's still time 
That's Morsken 
You finished 
Come on Miss Froy 
Oh Cut it out kid You're not drugged 
I'Il explain later 
Oh 
Oh I can't believe it 
Thank you my dear 
Thank you very much 
Careful 
Ready 
Yes 
You all right Miss Froy 
Yes thank you 
Look We're slowing down 
Look out 
Get back on the train 
I hope nothing goes wrong 
Aren't we stopping rather a long time 
The ambulance is going 
We'll be off in a jiffy 
sh she was an Englishwoman 
You are Bandriekan 
You can't do that 
You wouldn't dare 
I know too much Precisely 
I think we're over the border now 
Oh bless me 
What an unpleasant journey 
Never mind 
Okay 
Ah There you are 
What was that scream 
Surely it was only the train whistle 
It wasn't It was a woman 
Be careful 
Oh dear 
Oh dear Look here 
I haven't the faintest idea 
I I'm a children's governess you know 
Why are you holding out on us 
Tell us the truth 
I really don't know 
I 
What do you make it 
Teatime 
Well all the English will be there 
I'm going to take a look 
Come on We'd better stick together 
There's the old girl turned up 
What's the fellow driveling about 
What are you talking about 
Abductions diverted trains 
We're telling you the truth 
I'm not in the least interested 
Yes Things like that just don't happen 
We're not in England now 
I don't see what difference that makes 
We're stopping 
Do you see those cars 
Nonsense 
Look There go a couple of people 
The cars have obviously come to pick them up 
Uncoupling 
Not any longer 
Would you like to come and look 
Good Lord 
Let's have some of that brandy 
Seems a bit queer 
Someone's coming 
They can't possibly do anything to us 
We're British subjects 
I have come to offer the most sincere apologies 
An extremely serious incident has occurred 
I will inform the British embassy at once 
Well I was at Oxford Really 
So was I What year 
Would you 
Certainly 
That's fixed him 
That's all right He's only stunned 
What the blazes did you do that for 
Well I was at Cambridge 
What's that got to do with it 
You heard what he said didn't you 
I heard what she said 
That was a trick to get us off the train 
Thing like this might cause a war 
I'm going outside tell them what's occurred 
You were right Do you mind old man 
Certainly 
Look as if they mean business 
I'm afraid so 
They can't do anything 
It would mean an international situation 
It's happened before 
They're coming 
Don't let them in They'll murder us 
They daren't let us go now 
I order you to surrender at once 
Nothing doing 
Come any nearer I'll fire 
I've warned you 
Better take cover 
They'Il start any minute now 
Nasty jam this 
Don't like the look of it 
Got plenty of ammunition 
Whole pouch full 
Good Duck down you 
I'm not gonna fight 
It's madness 
It'll be safer to protest down here 
You're behaving like a pack of fools 
You heard what the mother superior said 
We surrender now we're in for it 
We'Il never get to the match now 
Give it to me No 
Give it to me 
What's going on here 
He's got a gun and he won't use it 
What's the idea 
Pacifist eh 
Won't work old boy 
Come on Hand it over 
I'm not afraid to use it 
He's talking rot He's a damn good shot 
Hope the old hand hasn't lost its cunning 
Rotten Only knocked his hat off 
Do you mind if I talk to you for a minute 
What now 
Hang on to this for me will you 
All right 
Keep your head low 
But you can't 
You'll never get away 
You'll be shot down 
I must take that risk 
Listen carefully 
In case I'm unlucky and you get through 
Then you are a spy 
I always think that's such a grim word 
Well what is the message 
It's a tune 
Tune 
I want you to memorize it Well go ahead 
The first part of it goes like this 
No don't bother I was brought up on music 
I can memorize anything 
Very well 
Hello The old girl's gone off her rocker 
I don't wonder 
Why don't you face it 
For goodness' sake Shut up Eric 
That's right 
Now we've got two chances instead of one 
You bet You sure you'll remember it 
Oh don't worry I won't stop whistling it 
We can't let her go like this 
This is a hell of a risk you're taking 
In this sort of job one must take risks 
I hope so too Good luck Good luck 
Will you help me 
Yes Right 
Hold your shirt Right you are 
Good bye 
Was she hit 
I'm not sure 
Well that's the end of my 12 
There's not much left here either 
Listen We've only got one chance now 
That's a bit of a tall order isn't it 
We'll bluff them with this 
Who's coming 
You can count on me 
Me too 
You jump out and switch them over Okay 
You idiots 
You're just inviting death 
I've had enough 
All right 
I'd rather be called a rat than die like one 
Think for a moment will you 
They're bound to give us a trial 
Very well You go your way I'Il go mine 
Hey where you off to 
I know what I'm about 
I'm doing the only sensible thing 
Oh let the fellow go if he wants to 
You don't understand 
I'm 
No please 
Why aren't we going Why aren't we going 
They said we were going Why aren't we 
If only he can get us away now He must 
They're moving away from the cars 
They're coming towards us 
Pity we haven't a few more rounds 
Gilbert Gilbert 
By gad we're off This gives us a chance 
Go on Keep going 
I say Do you know how to control this thing 
I watched the fellow start it 
Anyway I know something about it 
The blighters are chasing us Look 
We can't have far to go 
It's time for my little job changing the points 
Thank heavens we shall be in neutral territory 
That will not be necessary 
Will you please be seated 
Hope so 
Keep quite still until my friends arrive 
There's just one thing you don't know Captain 
Sit down please 
All right 
Where the devil's Charters 
Go ahead She's done it 
Quick 
Oh 
It's all right It's just my leg 
My word I'm glad all that's over aren't you 
Nothing at all They'll hush it up What 
I've got to remember a tune 
Remember 
Porter sir 
Uh no thanks 
Well we're home Gilbert 
Can't you stop humming that awful tune 
You must know it backwards 
I'm not taking any risks 
Charles be here to meet you 
I expect so 
I'm sorry 
I didn't mean that 
I 
I see 
Ready 
Yes 
Yes 
Any sign of Charles yet 
No I can't see him 
Well this is where we say good bye 
Oh what's the matter 
Charles 
Are you going anywhere 
Foreign Office 
Where are we going for our honeymoon 
I don't know 
Somewhere quiet 
Somewhere where there are no trains 
Wait a minute 
It's gone 
What's gone 
The tune 
I've forgotten it 
No Oh no 
Wait a minute Let me concentrate 
No no no no 
That's The Wedding March 
This is awful 
Miss Froy 
I had seen little of Holmes for some time 
Ah Mrs Hudson has Mr Holmes returned 
Oh he has indeed 
He came in early 
Must have been before 7:00 
'Morning Mrs Hudson' he says 
'Have you anything nice for my breakfast 
' as if he hadn't been away for four months 
You could have knocked me down with a feather 
Visitor 
An elderly gentleman 
They had words 
Indeed 
Why not 
Very good 
Thank you Mrs Hudson 
But as I waited for him to reappear 
Holmes you 
Wait wait 
What is it 
Air guns a rather special air gun in fact 
Damn 
Watson might I have a match 
Holmes you're hurt 
Scratches nothing nothing to signify 
You don't look well Holmes 
Well I have been using myself rather too freely 
I have been somewhat pressed but late 
How pressed 
I'll take some notes if I may 
Oh by all means 
This case 
This case it is unique in the annuals of crime 
All I knew was that it was important and abroad 
Marie Louise of Austria 
Indeed it is a history lesson in stone 
Gentlemen shall we come to the point 
I presume the Mona Lisa has been stolen 
and scandal 
How very fortunate 
Pardon 
Two good thumb prints 
This one seems well done 
I should like to meet him sometime 
It is very difficult to find 
To match the original color nearly impossible 
that is the most difficult to achieve of all 
And you can achieve it 
How 
That is my secret 
But of course you are joking Messier 
There there is your thief 
Not a pleasant specimen 
Mr Holmes France owes you a great debt 
But he must be arrested immediately 
He may have already sold it 
He is only a pawn in a much bigger game 
That is madness 
He can't sell it 
But how 
Minister please if I may explain 
Mr Holmes we must arrest him now 
No 
Now 
I was satisfied that I had recognized one of 
Professor Moriarity's agents 
The eyelids are a little weary 
But if you look at the paint work sir 
Will you excuse me 
I don't understand Professor 
I mean the price maybe 
Well now look I'll reconsider 
Hey what you guys up to 
Take your hands off me you nick 
Thanks for nothing 
That wretched Holmes has recovered the original 
These are worthless 
Destroy them burn them 
Do it yourself and let no one else see you 
Yes Professor Moriarity 
I must congratulate you Holmes 
Such an honor and so well deserved 
There was no great problem 
The case practically solved itself 
I hear you had a visitor this morning 
Ow 
But you cannot go up there sir 
You evidentially don't know me 
You stand fast 
Absolutely 
So it was you behind the Red Headed League 
A very ingenious and welcome tried idea 
High praise from you 
You crossed my path first on the 4th of January 
I was absolutely hampered in my plans 
The situation is becoming an impossible one 
Have you any suggestion to make 
You must drop it Mr Holmes 
You really must you know 
And what if I refuse 
It is necessary that you should withdraw 
Danger is part of my trade 
This is not danger 
It is inevitable destruction 
This is a duel between you and me Mr Holmes 
You hope to place me in the dark 
You hope to beat me 
You have paid me several compliments 
Mr Moriarity 
Let me pay you one in return when I say that if 
I were assured of the former eventuality 
I can promise you the one but not the other 
He is the Napoleon of crime Watson 
And now I'm ready to close on him 
If he doesn't close upon you first 
The continent 
I'd be delighted Holmes but where 
Anywhere 
It's all the same to me 
Yes but won't we have to dispose of 
Professor Moriarity first 
And that reminds me I must be on my way 
Won't you stay the night 
No it's too dangerous for you if I stay here 
We start tomorrow morning 
Tomorrow morning 
Oh yes it is most necessary 
We are now playing a double handed game with me 
tipped at the collar with red 
Excuse me sir I wonder if you speak Italian 
No I'm afraid not 
Not a sign of him sir 
If you're traveling you better get aboard 
Good heavens Holmes how you startled me 
It is still necessary to take every precaution 
I did rather fine Watson 
Well what will he do then 
What I should do 
Engage a special train 
But he'll arrive too late 
Let's arrest him as soon as he arrives 
No that would ruin everything 
No no and the rest is invisible 
Well what then 
We shall get ours at Canterbury 
But Holmes our luggage 
What will we do 
We shall go across country 
London Brighton and South Coast line 
I think we've got time for an early lunch 
So soon 
It fell out as Sherlock Holmes had predicted 
What do you think 
A common enough occurrence in the mountains 
Hmm 
He's given them the slip 
Why 
You will find me a very dangerous companion now 
Would you be rid of me 
No except for the reasons I've given 
We've been in tight places before together 
Never as tight as this one 
What was that 
See anything 
No nothing 
It's time we went on our way 
Hans we're on our way 
Uh Steiler 
Uh there it is 
It is indeed a fearful place 
Herr Dr Watson 
Herr Dr Watson 
Yes 
It is very urgent 
She's had a great hemorrhage 
Tuberculoses 
Oh no doubt 
It appears she's dying 
An English doctor would be a great consolation 
I'm afraid I must go back Holmes 
Of course 
A good plan 
Hey 
I trust she's no worse 
You didn't write this 
There is no sick English woman at the hotel 
No but it has the hotel mark 
He said 
He had not gone to Rosenlawy 
Holmes 
Holmes 
Holmes 
Indeed if I may make a full confession to you 
I was convinced that the letter was a hoax 
Ahh 
Mr Sherlock Holmes was distinguished 
I have ever known 
This way please Thank you 
Smile for the boys 
I think married men make the best husbands 
The pound is up the dollar is high 
That was very nice of you Thank you so much 
Miss West would you please make a statement 
Sonny 
But Miss West 
I feel like a visiting diplomat 
I'm doing a story for Harper's Bazaar 
Let's have coffee in the lounge shall we

Hmm she's pretty in a in a brittle way 
In a brittle way Has she uh you know 
She's got plenty 
Who wouldn't with that bankroll 
A lot of clothes a lot of care 
She'd have it in the dark without a dime 
Hey you kind of fell for her didn't you 
Well she's been at the bat enough times 
But she doesn't get that hit 
Why is she so important 
I was raised for vaudeville 
So what

Did I say it couldn't 
Please sit down You make me nervous

Then why did you smack her 
She told you that 
Listen um would you like a drink 
Yes thank you 
I'd like one 
Will you do it my way Mr O'Bannon 
What way is that

It's a good name 
Being seen together 
Happy marriages are never news 
Go on 
Will you do it

That's just right and it's my way 
Let the thing ride along as it is 
Pretend it's working 
Not on your life Why not 
Because I don't want it that way 
It was not my bright idea 
It's the intelligent thing to do Christopher

All right Lunch 
I can't give her much of my time either 
A couple of afternoons maybe on a day off

Mammy here's Miss Scarlett's vittles 
You can take that back 
I won't eat a bite 
Oh yes ma'am you is 
Put on the dress 'cause we're late already 
What's my lamb gonna wear 
That No you ain't 
You can't show your bosom before 3:00 
Keep your shawl on 
Oh dear 
Well John Wilkes 
So it seems Gerald 
Thank you kindly India 
We must greet them I can't stand Scarlett 
If you see the way she throws herself at Ashley 
Now that's your brother's business 
You're looking lovely 
Perfectly lovely darling 
I just can't take my eyes off it 
Good morning It's a pleasure to see you 
Ashley 
Scarlett my dear 
I've been looking for you everywhere 
I've got something I must tell you 
But come say hello to my cousin Melanie first 
Here's Scarlett 
I'm so glad to see you again 
Melanie Hamilton 
What a surprise to run into you here 
I do so want us to be 
Nobody could accuse Melanie of being insincere 
Could they my dear 
Then she's not like you is she Ashley 
But oh Miss O'Hara I 
She never even noticed Charles before 
Oh thank you Miss Scarlett 
You needn't be so amused Look at her 
I'll see what I can do Miss Scarlett 
What's your sister so mad about 
No you're not 
I won't say that I'm mad at you 
What have we done 
You haven't been near me all day 
I was counting on eating barbecue with you two 
Well you are Scarlett 
Cathleen who's that 
Who 
That man looking at us and smiling 
The nasty dark one 
My dear don't you know That's Rhett Butler 
Scarlett Why my dear he isn't received 
And then he refused to marry her 
No but she was ruined just the same 
Ashley 
Happy 
You love Twelve Oaks as I do 
It's so unaware that it may not last forever 
But we don't have to be afraid for us 
No war can come into our world Ashley 
Whatever comes 
I'll love you just as I do now until I die 
Isn't this better than sitting at a table 
I'll go get her dessert 
Here she said me 
I think 
I think Charles Hamilton may get it 
Oh thank you Miss O'Hara 
Thank you Go get it 
Miss O'Hara 
I love you 
I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought 
Why do I have to take a nap 
I'm not tired 
How was Ashley today Scarlett 
You mind your own business 
Who cares 
That's right 
There's no other way 
Fight That's right Fight 
There won't even be a battle 
They'll just turn and run every time 
One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees 
What does the captain of our troop say 
What do you mean sir 
There's not a cannon factory in the whole South 
What difference does that make to a gentleman 
No I'm not hinting 
That's treacherous 
I refuse to listen to any renegade talk 
I'm sorry if the truth offends you 
Apologies aren't enough sir 
I apologize again for all my shortcomings 
You did everything but call him out 
He refused to fight 
Not quite that Charles 
He refused to take advantage of you 
I'll show him No please 
Ashley 
Who are you hiding from in here 
What are you up to 
What is this Scarlett 
Oh Ashley Ashley I love you 
Scarlett I love you I do 
You cut your teeth on it 
Oh don't tease me now 
Have I your heart my darling 
I love you I love you 
You mustn't say such things 
Oh you do care don't you 
Yes 
But how can we do that 
Don't you want to marry me 
I'm going to marry Melanie But you can't 
How can I make you understand 
You're so young and unthinking 
You don't know what marriage means 
I know I love you and I want to be your wife 
You don't love Melanie 
She's like me Scarlett 
But you love me 
How could I help loving you 
Well why don't you say it you coward 
You're afraid to marry me 
You mustn't say such things about Melanie 
Now Scarlett be fair 
I never at any time 
You did it's true you did 
In the middle of that beautiful love scene 
Sir you are no gentleman 
And you miss are no lady 
Don't think I hold that against you 
Ladies have never held any charm for me 
What was it 
Your passion for living 
How dare you You aren't fit to wipe his boots 
Oh Melanie you're just too good to be true 
Yes and she knows Charles belongs to me 
I think you're being very mean to her 
War's declared 
Miss O'Hara 
They're going right away I'm going too 
Oh Miss O'Hara will you be sorry 
Miss O'Hara I told you I loved you 
Just anything I promise 
Yes Mr Hamilton I will 
You will You'll marry me 
You'll wait for me 
I don't think I'd want to wait 
When may I speak to your father 
Will you excuse me dear 
Mr O'Hara Mr O'Hara 
It'll be a week at least before they call on me 
Was it Now we're really and truly sisters 
Well I don't care I'm too young to be a widow 
You ain't supposed to be around people 
You's in mourning For what 
What is it 
Oh baby 
What is it 
Oh Mother 
Savannah perhaps What would I do in Savannah 
Well Atlanta then 
There's lots going on there 
Melanie 
Yes 
You'd like it really 
All right then Now stop your crying and smile 
You can take Prissy with you 
Start packing Miss Scarlett's things Mammy 
I'll go write the necessary letters 
Atlanta Savannah would be better for you 
You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta 
What trouble are you talking about 
He belongs to Miss Melanie 
It was splendid of her to make the sacrifice 
Ladies and gentlemen 
I have important news 
And now a happy surprise for all of us 
None other than our friend from Charleston 
I met you last at my husband's home 
That's kind of you to remember Mrs Wilkes 
It was in the library 
We're in mourning 
Thank you Capt Butler 
But it's your wedding ring ma'am 
It may help my husband more off my finger 
Here 
And you Mrs Hamilton 
I know just how much that means to you 
Melanie 
Yes Dr Meade 
I'll say one thing 
The war makes the most peculiar widows 
Now why be silly 
I'm neither noble nor heroic 
But you are a blockade runner 
For profit and profit only 
And now ladies and gentlemen 
She did Oh dear oh dear 
Where are my smelling salts 
I think I shall faint 
Come gentlemen do I hear your bids 
Make your offers Don't be bashful gentlemen

$25 for Miss Fanny Elsing 
Only $25 to give your $150 in gold 
For what lady sir For Mrs Charles Hamilton 
For whom sir 
Mrs Charles Hamilton 
Dr Meade I said Mrs Charles Hamilton 
She will not consider it sir 
Choose your partners for the Virginia reel 
We've sort of shocked the Confederacy 
You do waltz divinely Capt Butler 
Don't start flirting with me 
I want more than flirting from you 
How sweet how kind 
Oh the darling thing 
Oh Rhett 
Oh it's so long since I've had anything new 
Awful 
Just awful 
Oh Rhett let me do it 
But Rhett I don't know how I'd dare wear it 
You will though 
And another thing 
Oh what do they 
I'm not kind 
I always get paid 
Open your eyes and look at me 
You should be kissed and often 
And by someone who knows how 
And I don't know why I let you come and see me 
But cheer up the war can't last much longer 
Really Rhett 
Why 
Yes I suppose he's in it 
Casualty list

Hold on 
Let's not talk about the war 
It's the very last of my father's fine Madeira 
I saved it to wish Ashley a Merry Christmas 
I meant it my dear 
It was a lovely Christmas gift 
Only generals have tunics like this nowadays 
I'm so happy you like it dear 
Where did you get the cloth 
Oh you will take good care of it won't you 
You won't let it get torn 
Promise me 
Good night my dear 
She hasn't changed her mind 
Ashley let me go to the depot with you 
Oh Ashley I've got a present for you too 
Why Scarlett it's beautiful 
Tie it on me my dear 
You made it yourself 
There's something you can do for me 
What is it 
You see if I were killed and she 
Oh you mustn't say that It's bad luck 
Say a prayer quickly 
The end 
Yes Is that all Ashley 
All except goodbye 
Oh Ashley I can't let you go 
You must be brave No 
You must How else can I bear going 
Not just your sweet face my dear but you

Haven't you been told twice already 
It's good money even if it is mine 
I'm sure you're very generous No I'm not

Some folks here wouldn't feel that way 
Look Mrs Meade

It's gold 
Let me see that handkerchief 
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me 
Yankees Yankees

English

I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy 
I don't like the way you're treating them 
Nevertheless Katie Scarlett I don't like it 
I shall speak to Mrs O'Hara about it 
You are all working so hard 
I can't lie in bed doing nothing 
Please Scarlett let me Stop being noble 
Oh I didn't think of it that way 
You ain't very friendly are you 
You Yankees have been here before 
Regular little spitfire ain't you 
What have you got hidden in your hand 
I'm glad you killed him 
Scarlett what happened 
What is it 
Tell Katie Scarlett she must be more careful 
What a cool liar you are Melly 
We've got to get him out of here and bury him

But even so we've got to hide him 
I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself 
Oh Melly look Look 
We haven't got time 
Look in his other pockets 
Hurry hurry 
We've got to get him out of here Here 
Don't be silly I won't look at you 
Now go back to bed You'll be dead if you don't 
I'll clean up the mess when I've buried him 
No I'll clean it up 
I won't think about that now 
I'll think about that tomorrow 
It's over It's all over 
The war 
It's not possible Why did we ever fight 
Ashley will be coming home 
Yes Ashley will be coming home 
While we were marching through Georgia 
We bring the jubilee Hurrah hurrah 
The flag that makes you free 
So we sing the chorus from Atlanta to the sea 
While we were marching through Georgia 
Get out of the road rebel Get out of the way 
Have you room in your carriage for a dying man 
Jump you gray backed beggars 
Act like they won the war 
Come on 
I'm gonna put these britches in the boiling pot 
Crawling clothes and dysentery 
It's humiliating how you treat Mr Kennedy 
Come on Beau 
Nice little fellow 
Were you in Cobb's Legion 
Captured Oh thank heavens then he isn't 
Oh my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison 
I've just heard that Ashley was taken prisoner 
Ashley a prisoner Yes 
I hope so Melly 
Well now I haven't a cent to my name 
Who has nowadays 
I'm sure I can speak for Pa You go ask her now 
Oh thank you Miss Scarlett 
Excuse me excuse me 
More trouble than he guesses 
At least there'd be one less mouth to feed 
I hope this one isn't hungry He'll be hungry 
I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate 
Darling 
Turn me loose it's Ashley 
He's her husband ain't he 
Here stir this soap 
Yes ma'am Miss Scarlett ma'am 
$10 Why 
That won't be enough 
What in heaven's name are you talking about 
But how much more have we got to pay 
I hear the taxman say $300 $300 
Might just as well be $3 million 
I'll go ask Mr Ashley 
Oh he ain't got no $300 Miss Scarlett 
Well I can ask him if I want to can't I 
Asking ain't getting 
The Yankees want $300 more in taxes 
What shall we do 
Ashley what's to become of us 
Those that haven't are winnowed out 
You're right Scarlett 
Oh Scarlett I I'm a coward 
You Ashley a coward 
What are you afraid of 
But the war did come 
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits 
I saw men crumple up in agony when I shot them 
A world in which there's no place for me 
Escape 
Oh Ashley you're wrong 
Oh Ashley let's run away 
I'd work for you I'd do anything for you 
And anyway Melanie can't 
Have you forgotten it 
Can you honestly say you don't love me 
No I don't love you It's a lie 
You couldn't leave your father and the girls 
I could leave them I'm sick of them 
I'm tired of them 
Yes you're sick and tired 
That's why you're talking this way 
There's only one way you can help me 
Take me away There's nothing to keep us here 
Nothing 
Nothing except honor 
We won't do this I tell you 
It won't happen again 
I'm going to take Melanie and the baby and go 
Say it you love me All right I'll say it 
I love your courage and your stubbornness 
But Scarlett I'm not going to forget her 
Nothing to fight for 
Nothing to live for Yes there is something 
I still have this 
It won't happen again 
Stop 
Well Emmy's Mrs Wilkerson now 
You can't speak that way to my wife Wife 
High time you made her your wife 
When were we ever friends with the likes of you 
Still high and mighty ain't you 
I know your father's turned idiot 
You can't pay your taxes 
But I'll wait for the Sheriff's sale 
That's all of Tara you'll ever get 
You'll be sorry for that 
I'll show you who the owner of Tara is 
Pa come back 
Yankee coward 
Lordsy Miss Scarlett 
You think I'd sell Pa's watch 
And don't cry 
I can stand everybody's tears but yours 
I can't think about Pa 
I can't think of anything but that $300 
Rhett 
I haven't any clothes 
Not with Miss Ellen's portieres 
Not while I got breath in me 
Great balls of fire They're my portieres now 
I's going to Atlanta with you 
With you and that new dress 
Kings and treys huh Too good for me Major 
Says she's his sister 
Another sister 
This is a jail not a harem Capt Butler 
No Major she ain't one of those 
This one's got her mammy with her She has 
$340 
My debts do mount up don't they Major 
Thank you Major Excuse me gentlemen 
It's all right Corporal 
My sister has brought me no files or saws 
On the forehead like a good brother No thanks 
I'll wait and hope for better things 
I simply couldn't sleep for thinking 
It's not true they're going to hang you 
Would you be sorry Oh Rhett 
Well don't worry yet 
What a leading question 
Oh Scarlett don't say that 
In a minute I shall cry 
Scarlett can it be possible that 
Can what be possible Rhett 
I have Rhett I know I have 
It's well worth it 
What have you done with your hands 
You've worked with them like a field hand 
What are you up to 
But I do care 
What is it 
Money 
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara 
Not interested 
A mortgage on Tara 
What would I do with a farm 
You wouldn't lose 
Have you nothing better 
You once said you loved me 
If you still love me Rhett 
No I haven't forgotten 
You're not worth $300 
Won't you please give me the money 
I couldn't give you the money if I wanted to 
My funds are in Liverpool not in Atlanta 
Here here here stop it 
Want the Yankees to see you like this 
I enjoyed hearing what you had to say Cheer up 
Tell him Belle Watling 
Where you been lately 
Thought you'd deserted Capt Butler 
Oh I keep myself occupied Help me out 
Does you know a dyed haired woman 
Fresh and green 
Right off the farm 
Hey what are you doing tonight Susy

There's nothing like that in Ohio 
You know what we're going to do What 
Forty acres and a mule 
Gee 
What's your hurry sister 
What's come over this here town 
Out of our way trash 
Get out of the way here Get away

Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett 
Why Frank Kennedy 
And Mammy 
It sure is good to see home folks 
Didn't Miss Suellen tell you about my store 
I don't remember 
Have you a store 
This 
Won't you come in and look around a bit 
I can't help being proud of it 
You're not making money 
Well I can't complain 
In fact I'm mighty encouraged 
Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant 
Are you doing as well as all that 
Yes I am Miss Scarlett 
And lumber too 
Well that's only a sideline 
A sideline Frank 
What do you want a home for

I don't mean a thing 
You'd better stay to supper too 
What's the matter Miss Scarlett 
Miss Suellen's not ill is she 
Oh how awful to have such a mean sister 
You must tell me Miss Scarlett 
Don't leave me on tenterhooks 
Oh I'm sorry to be the one to tell you 
Oh it's cold I left my muff at home 
Would you mind if I put my hand in your pocket 
But Melanie you don't realize what she's done 
She's gone and married my Mr Kennedy 
He's my beau and she's gone and married him 
I hate Tara 
It's all my fault 
I couldn't let you do anything like that and 
Well anyway it's done now 
Yes it's done now 
What do you mean 
I'm going to New York 
I've arranged to get a position in a bank there 
But you can't do that 
I wouldn't be any good to you 
I don't know anything about the lumber business 
You know as much as you do about banking 
And I'd give you half the business Ashley 
That's generous of you Scarlett 
But it isn't that 
I'd bury forever any hope of standing alone 
Oh is that all 
No Scarlett

What do you want to arrest him for 
I've seen him drunker 
I've seen you drunker And you've seen me 
What are you laughing at 
This isn't your night to teach that lesson Tom 
These two have been with me tonight Yes sir

I hope you'll forgive me Mrs Wilkes I 
If you'll go and leave us in peace please 
Well I say I'm sorry and well I am sorry 
Come on Sergeant 
Lock that door Pull down the shades 
He's all right It's only in the shoulder 
Get him on the bed where I can dress the wound 
I think I can walk 
It's not worth the effort Which way 
In here 
Mammy I want some hot water Yes sir 
And lint for bandages I'll find some 
Now what can I use for a probe 
If I only had my bag 
Were you really there 
What did it look like 
Good heavens Mrs Meade remember yourself 
I was too late 
So I took them to Belle's 
And she took them in 
I 
And now I'll go and see what Dr Meade needs 
No 
Well where is he 
He's dead 
Who is it 
It's Miss Watling 
Oh Miss Watling Won't you come in the house 
Oh no I couldn't do that Miss Wilkes 
You come in and sit a minute with me 
Why Miss Wilkes you must have lost your mind 
Why I'm

And I don't forget a kindness 
I got a boy myself and so I 
Oh you have 
Does he live 
Oh no ma'am he ain't here in Atlanta 
He ain't never been here 
He's off at school 
I ain't seen him since he was little 
She's a mighty cold woman 
Prancing about Atlanta by herself 
She killed her husband same as if she shot him 
Please don't freeze me Miss Wilkes 
I forgot how you liked her 
Well anyway I got to be going 
That wouldn't do you no good 
I'll understand 
I should be proud to speak to you 
Proud to be under obligation to you 
I hope we meet again 
Oh no ma'am that wouldn't be fitting 
Good night Miss Wilkes 
Good night Miss Watling 
And you're wrong about Mrs Kennedy 
She's brokenhearted about her husband 
Great balls of fire 
Tell him I'll be right down Mammy 
She says she's coming 
You don't like me Mammy 
It's no good Scarlett 
What 
The cologne 
I'm sure I don't know what you mean 
What if I have Is that any of your affair 
Don't drink alone Scarlett 
What is it 
This is more than losing old Frank 
I'm so afraid 
I'm afraid now 
I'm afraid of dying and going to hell 
He was Suellen's beau and he loved her not me 
And I made him miserable And I killed him 
Yes I did I killed him 
Dry your eyes 
I'm glad Mother's dead 
I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me 
And I certainly have turned out disappointing 
Say it then and get out 
What is it 
That I can't go on any longer without you 
So I see I shall have to marry you 
I never heard of such bad taste 
Turn me loose you varmint and get out of here 
I mean my dear Mrs Kennedy 
Dare I name it Can it be love 
You're coarse and you're conceited 
Besides I shall never marry again 
Oh yes you will and you'll marry me 
You You 
I don't love you 
And I don't like being married 
Did you ever think of marrying just for fun 
Marriage fun Fiddle dee dee 
Fun for men you mean Hush up 
Do you want them to hear you 
You've been married to a boy and an old man 
Stop it 
Do you hear me Scarlett Stop it

Look at me and try to tell me the truth 
Did you say yes because of my money 
Well Yes Partly 
Partly 
Fond of me 
Yes you're right my dear 
Heaven help the man who ever really loves you 
What kind of a ring would you like my darling 
That would be just heavenly 
Still the little hypocrite 
Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye 
But I will come back 
What are you thinking about Scarlett 
I'm thinking about how rich we are 
Yes of course you can if it amuses you 
Then I'll divorce you 
Mules 
Why mules 
I never heard anything more true 
Then I'll take her a petticoat 
Wake up Wake up 
You were having another nightmare 
I was so cold and hungry and so tired I 
Find what honey I don't know 
I always dream the same dream and I never know 
It seems to be hidden in the mist 
Darling 
Would you do something for me if I asked you 
You know I would 
Will you take me away from here 
Don't you like New Orleans 
Will you take me to Tara 
Yes Scarlett of course I will 
We'll go tomorrow 
You're part of it and it's part of you 
Would you

Rhett you are good to me 
Yes and it can be as ornate as you want: 
Marble terraces stained glass windows and all

Oh darling you mustn't think unkindly of her 
Yes and what good is Tara 
Great Jehoshaphat

Here take the whole bottle 
Dr Meade says you may go in now Capt Butler 
This sure is a happy day to me

And why shouldn't I 
Great balls of fire

It's Melanie May I come in 
Come in Melly 
As blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag 
That's it That's what we'll call her 
Bonnie Blue Butler 
Try again Mammy 
Twenty inches 
Twenty inches I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty 
You've simply got to make it 18 5 again Mammy 
And there ain't nothing to do about it 
There is something to do about it 
I just won't have any more babies 
I'll have supper in my room 
I got your message

No objections to that I hope 
No 
Yes 
I mean I don't care where you have your supper 
Rhett

What has that got to do with it 
It's no use You wouldn't understand 
You know I'm sorry for you Scarlett 
Sorry for me

Do you think I care if you like your brandy 
You're drunk and I'm going to bed 
Sit down 
So she stood by you did she 
I will not listen 
Yes you'll listen 
Miss Melly's a fool but not the kind you think 
And she loves you 
Though just why she does I'm sure I don't know 
As it is though 
If you get out of that chair once more 
Why doesn't he make up his mind 
Rhett you 
Observe my hands my dear 
I could tear you to pieces with them 
But it wouldn't 
That'll block him out 
Take your hands off me you drunken fool 
Never more than now when you're cornered 
I'm not cornered 
Good night 
Jealous am I 
Yes I suppose I am 
How do I know 
They're gentlemen

A great lady A very great lady

No I don't know that I do 
Why her last words were about you 
What did she say 
She said: Be kind to Capt Butler 
He loves you so 
Did she say anything else 
She said 
She asked me to look after Ashley too 
What do you mean 
What are you doing 
I'm leaving you my dear 
No you're wrong 
Terribly wrong I don't want a divorce 
Spare us this last 
This last Oh Rhett do listen to me 
I believe you What about Ashley Wilkes 
I never really loved Ashley 
No Scarlett I tried everything 
I wanted you 
But it's no use now 
I liked to think that Bonnie was you 
But when she went she took everything 
Rhett please don't say that 
I'm so sorry I'm so sorry for everything 
My darling you're such a child 
Here take my handkerchief 
Rhett where are you going 
I'm going to Charleston Back where I belong 
Please Please take me with you 
I'm through with everything here 
I want peace 
Do you know what I'm talking about 
No I only know that I love you 
That's your misfortune 
Frankly my dear I don't give a damn 
Oh I can't let him go I can't 
There must be some way to bring him back 
I'll think about it tomorrow 
But I must think about it 
What is there to do 
What is there that matters 
It's this from which you get your strength 
The red earth of Tara 
Tara 
Tara 
Home 
I'll go home 
And I'll think of some way to get him back 
After all tomorrow is another day 
I've never heard a more beautiful Angelus 
Who is the bellringer of Notre Dame 
Quasimodo Your Majesty 
The people simply call him the Hunchback 
What an odd name 
What do you call this apparatus 
What is it for 
To print books Your Majesty 
For whom 
For the people 
They will learn to read when they can get books 
This is more beautiful than the printed book 
Nevertheless the printing press is a miracle 
A horrifying miracle 
Horrifying 
This small press 
The Nile rat kills the crocodile 
This small press can destroy a kingdom 
Oh come my High Justice don't exaggerate 
What is that 
Let me see it 
On the Freedom of Thought 
Who wrote it 
Pierre Gringoire 
Who is he 
A French poet Your Majesty 
A heretic sire 
To spread him is to communicate disease 
How do you know 
To me it's a new form of expression of thought 
Out there is the old form 
A book in stone glorifying the spirit of France 
No I'm not such a fool 
Why do you stop us 
It's the new law 
You're Gypsies 
You came yesterday we come today 
Let them pass 
It's Fools' Day 
Stop her 
Catch her 
What's the matter Héléne 
Go home quickly and light the candle 
I can't 
Well what's he trying to do 
It's not round it's flat The idiot 
Do you recollect that letter we had from 
What's his name 
reach the Indies 
It's flat 
I'm greatly tempted to endow the venture 
Columbus 
Who knows 
It's flat 
Everywhere it's flat 
Oh let's listen to the play 
The old can never last 
The new is claiming its place 
It's foolish to cling to the past 
It pains me to relate that death 
is the fate of noble and peasant alike 
You are born in a womb 
And end in a tomb 
The king's coming 
Pennies 
Pennies 
How's business 
Bad 
How's business 
I'll tend to that You'd better 
You rest and live and rest again 
Beware you do not live in vain 
And if you eat too much you throw it up again 
You stupid ignorant drunkards you 
I offer you truth 
We will now choose the King of Fools 
Applicants come forth 
Men women 
The ugliest face wins the crown 
Ugly faces 
Ugly faces 
How do you like this face 
The ugly is very appealing to man 
It's a matter of taste No it's instinct 
There's a devilish fascination in it 
We extract pleasure from horror 
Only the mob sire 
Think so 
Horrible 
That's the prettiest ugliness I've ever seen 
Awful 
Beautiful 
What 
That girl what a beauty 
I've never seen her before 
Have you 
She is pretty 
Who is she 
What's her name 
The people seem to like her and so do I 
Doctor lend me half a livre A half livre 
Afraid I won't repay you 
She's a Gypsy sire 
Who cares about her race 
She's pretty 
Doesn't she make your pulse beat faster 
What about you Doctor 
What's the matter 
That eye staring at me 
Somebody's in there It's an animal 
Let's get under there and see what it is 
Get him out of there 
Get under 
Get after him He's going out the other way 
Stay here 
Make him the king 
And now we want to make you King of Fools 
What do you say 
What's the matter 
Are you deaf 
The plague to you 
I offer you the fools' crown and you bite me 
He's deaf the bells have made him so 
Deaf maybe he's dumb too 
Show him the crown 
King Quasimodo Quasi Quasimodo 
Quasimodo ruler of fools we bow 
I am the true King of Fools 
I battle for beauty and the ugly gets crowned 
What greater fool can there be than I 
Stop 
He can't take away our king 
No bills only petitions But I need money 
The actors must be paid The play was ordered 
This is no time to ask for money It never is 
So we go hungry 
Here don't push 
Don't push I must see the king 
I must 
Must 
Hey you Gypsy 
Let me see your city permit 
Catch her 
Stop her 
Stop her 
Stop her 
Sanctuary 
We've got to arrest her 
She's a Gypsy 
Church is sanctuary for all 
The power of the law ends at this threshold 
It's no use 
The king himself could do nothing here 
Don't be afraid 
You are safe here 
What have you done 
Why are they after you 
That's not your fault 
It's an act of God 
Take her to the bell tower 
Quasimodo is not here Your Grace 
Where is he 
I don't know Your Grace 
Where is my brother 
Claude 
I must speak to you What is it 
It's about Quasimodo 
Where is he now 
You must impress upon him again 
But you have more influence over him than I 
He's your foundling Jean 
You picked him up on the church steps not I 
Quasimodo is back now I'll take you to him 
Who's that 
The Virgin Mary the Mother of God 
The Mother of God 
How can I speak to her 
Kneel down and pray as the others are doing 
Give me security 
Give me happiness 
Give me always a good home 
Give me a rich husband 
Give me beauty 
Give me a rich harvest Give me prosperity 
Give me happiness 
Take all I have but please help my people 
They are in great need in great danger 
What are you doing in Notre Dame 
I'm praying 
You cannot pray here 
You are a heathen 
Who are you 
You're not a priest and yet you look like one 
I am what I wish to be 
Get up and leave this church 
I 
Yes 
Dancing isn't sinful to me it's like talking 
Get up Leave me alone 
Your hand 
There's the mark of the devil on it 
You witch 
For saying that I shall have you hanged 
Now I know who you are 
Mother of God don't let him hang me 
Protect me 
Protect me 
You don't know anything about my people 
Surely we'd use it for our own benefit 
You mustn't talk like that in here 
The Mother of God is listening 
Never speak just be here 
Look 
They're like the high pines in the forest 
It is so quiet and peaceful here 
You know the birds and deer eat out of my hand 
I know 
You like animals 
Yes 
You say that 
You 
Then you cannot hate as much as you pretend to 
Somewhere in your heart there must be love 
I know 
I see it in your eyes 
God has shown me the goodness in you 
Surely he'll show me a way to help my people 
So you see I have to speak to the king 
Please do make him listen to me 
He will 
Whenever we steal it's because we're hungry 
My people have good hearts and we love you 
You little witch 
I merely meant that I might consider it 
Where shall I send you my answer 
To Notre Dame 
Yes Your Majesty Good 
Then I'll send my message here 
Oh thank you 
Thank you 
Thank you Mother of God 
Thank you 
Thank you 
I must go and tell my people 
Wait Why 
You live here in sanctuary don't you 
Don't be so disturbed 
I often like to go there myself 
Come let me show you 
Don't be afraid 
It's Quasimodo the bellringer 
He's harmless 
Don't run away 
Come with me 
You beast you monster 
Let me go What have I done 
Let me go 
Let me go 
Devil 
You unholy monster Let her go 
Help 
Help 
Save her save her 
What's the noise 
What are you yelling about 
There it's the Hunchback 
Save her save her 
Take her 
Take the girl 
Where's everybody running to 
What's happened 
The guards have caught someone 
A criminal 
Who is it 
It's the Hunchback 
Let me hang him Leave that to the law 
Don't let him get away Tie him up well 
Stop that biting or I'll knock your teeth out 
What's your name 
Esmeralda 
I'll remember it and I'll see you again 
Come on you beast 
Come on 
Come on go inside 
No no 
I'd better wait out here 
Never wait for a man my dear 
Congratulations 
So you got him Thanks to your help 
My help 
Yes you yelled loud enough 
I would arouse all Paris against such monsters 
Is the Gypsy girl your sweetheart 
And remember I will repay you not she 
Pennies sir 
Pennies sir 
Where's the king 
He's busy now 
You'll have to wait 
Esmeralda you belong to us now 
Who's the king here 
I and nobody else give the kiss of initiation 
Many of our tribe have found this a haven 
You too will find peace and a home here 
What's the matter 
He doesn't want to pay his daily share 
Come with me 
Leave him alone 
You know what the rules are 
Pay up your share or 
Who's that 
A stranger 
How did he get in 
Is the guard asleep 
Let me see him 
Who are you 
Permit me to introduce myself 
Do you know where you are 
I can imagine Let me hang him 
He's a spy 
He's a doctor 
I'm a poet whose play was done at the festival 
It's a rule 
I'm not a spy You can't 
No 
What a pity 
My ballad could make you immortal 
What 
What did you say 
Say it again I mean 
I mean I 
Let me hang him please 
Are you trying to cheat me 
Keep me alive and you will live in history 
Don't put your oar in 
Besides I belong here naturally 
Good intentions are not enough 
They've never put an onion in a soup yet 
You'll have to undergo a test 
Then we'll see if you're good for anything 
Bring him down 
And now then up you go up 
Stand on the stool 
And then 
Then you hang 
Can you do it 
Try it 
Please little bells don't jingle 
My life depends on you 
There must be something easier I could 
I could try 
Too bad 
And I'd almost come to like him 
Wait 
Let me hang him 
Girls 
Poet for sale poet for sale 
Poet for sale 
What does that mean 
A charming idea 
Going 
Going 
Goodbye Goodbye 
And thank you my friend 
Gone Gone 
That neck 
Wait wait 
Are you going to hang that man 
Surely 
Unless you take him for your husband 
I'll take him 
Well 
What do you want her or not 
My rope my rope 
The wedding cup 
Take it from Esmeralda drink and break it 
And he had such a nice neck 
Let's escort them to the bridal chamber 
Happy are the cats and mice 
Even the lice 
Happy are the cats and mice 
Even the lice 
Jump and sing until it's light 
This is a beggar's wedding night 
We must have a light 
Here is flint and tinder 
Now a little wood Let me help you 
No it's a woman's part to build the fire 
But it was a man who first brought it to earth 
Who 
As we do 
Just as we do 
Oh Esmeralda I feel 
How can I tell you how I feel 
And now here we are together married 
Esmeralda 
What did I say to hurt you 
Nothing 
You must tell me 
Who is Phoebus 
The sun god 
Why do you ask 
Yes 
I'm sorry if I hurt you 
My friend 
Do you know what friendship is 
And love 
That's to be two and at the same time one 
The what The proper balance 
You're a juggler 
No I'm sorry I can't juggle 
But you can learn 
I'll teach you 
Look 
That's wonderful 
I could never do it 
Try it 
It's no use 
Don't talk 
Balance it 
No use 
What's the matter 
He has an order to arrest all the Gypsies 
No only the girls 
Round them up round them up 
Good morning Your Honor 
What is it 
The Gypsy girls are ready for your inspection 
Not yet Your Honor 
Find out at once Yes Your Honor 
Quiet 
Quiet 
Speak up prisoner 
The judge is deaf 
Your name 
Your age 
Your profession 
What is your defense 
Quick and to the point 
Quasimodo 
So you plead guilty 
Twenty five next month 
For that you shall be whipped 
Bellringer of Notre Dame 
That's different 
Next case 
for his attack upon a woman 
Today 
That's life 
He's getting what he deserves 
It's a shame flogging that cripple 
Poor wretch 
Master Pierrat 
You could if you'd been whipped once 
Have you 
Now I buy protection 
From whom 
The nobility 
The guardians of the old and holy traditions 
The very same 
It's quite all right 
The ruling class didn't say Work or starve 
It said Starve for you shall not work 
And I starved 
Of which I am member 7 419 
You needn't be ashamed 
True we're not great thieves like the nobles 
Right 
We will 
Only the chief of justice can do that 
Isn't the archbishop his brother 
Twenty nine thirty thirty one 
That's no whipping He hasn't shed a tear 
Those possessed of the devil never do 
It's the whipper's fault 
Yes 
Why 
I know I know I know 
Isn't there any way to stop the whipping 
I wish I had the power 
Forty nine fifty 
It is the same throughout France 
We have to build more prisons 
We're far too lenient What'd you find out 
Where is he 
At the pillory The council is dismissed 
Water 
Did you see that 
And I thought he loved the Hunchback 
Where have you been 
With my people 
Water 
Water 
There's your water 
Claude I couldn't prevent it 
He never did anything like it before 
The hour's up 
All right 
She gave me water 
Are we not all God's creatures 
placed in the center of the universe 
to rule with love as our Father in Heaven 
Imagine all the people reading this 
You're hurting me 
I should have made you my chief torturer 
I beg your pardon sire 
How often would you say 
Twice a year Twice a year 
At least 
Would that make me live longer 
It would 
Good 
What's the matter 
Why are the bells ringing at this hour 
And so strangely 
What's the matter with the Hunchback 
You see 
It is Quasimodo 
He's getting crazier every day 
Yes he certainly has changed 
What do you mean 
That's right He keeps mumbling her name 
Maybe he's in love with her 
Is the lead hot enough to pour 
Who is she 
The Gypsy girl 
She's been invited to dance here tonight 
The world looks beautiful this way 
Be sensible 
Please remember why you are here 
To divert the noble lords and ladies of Paris 
Are you ready 
Yes I am 
Come on Bimbo 
Don't forget your cue Esmeralda 
What have I done 
Why do you pursue me 
What have you done 
I have sought a tranquil existence and had it 
Until I saw you 
In every book I read I see your face 
Let me go They are waiting for me to dance 
I don't want them to see you dance 
Come away from here 
I want you for myself alone 
This is Aristotle the great mathematician 
The miracle goat 
Come Fleur let's all dance 
Well Bimbo this is no party for us 
Come on Aristotle 
Who are you 
Where do you come from 
Speak up 
Why do I do this 
Why 
Because you love me Because I love you 
Forever 
Forever is a long time 
Tomorrow 
You see love is only a part of my life 
It's a very sweet part I admit 
For me it is everything 
It's all my life 
There is someone here 
What is it 
Don't worry 
Say again you love me I love you 
More than anything in the world 
I can't do any more than just love you I can 
You are a woman 
So you won't love me after tonight 
Perhaps not 
Let's get away from here 
There is somebody near us 
I'm afraid We'll stay my love 
Murder 
Murder 
The Gypsy she did it 
There's the knife Arrest her 
Bertrand Guillaume why don't you stop him 
It's impossible We can't make him stop 
Something's happened to him He's going mad 
We've tried everything We can't even reach him 
Go and get more help 
We must stop him 
He'll awaken all Paris 
He's stopped 
I've been looking for you Good 
I am glad you came 
Where have you been 
I've been waiting for you all evening 
Oh let's go down to my room 
I have a surprise for you 
I want you to hear some new music 
There's a young Italian composer 
What's the matter 
You may not want a murderer in your room 
What do you mean 
You are the servant of God 
You must help me 
Claude speak 
He that smiteth a man so that he shall die 
shall be surely put to death 
I can't help a murderer 
Then she must die 
Who must die 
This Gypsy girl who has made me a murderer 
But she is not guilty Yes she is 
She has bewitched me Therefore she must die 
Die for your crime 
That's devil's logic You can't believe that 
I do 
A sorceress once bewitched Bruno de Firenze 
He had her burned and was saved 
This girl's death shall be my redemption 
You're mad 
Then my duty is to help the girl not you 
Claude 
You are my brother 
I am no longer your brother 
Who's there 
Darling 
You don't believe I killed him 
I know you didn't 
How's Aristotle 
Your hands are like ice 
You aren't afraid are you 
Not now 
Oh Gringoire 
Why did I ever come to Paris 
Don't cry darling 
For that I deserve to die You will not 
I will get you free 
You will look after my people when I'm gone 
Don't talk like that 
Yes darling 
Forgive me even though it is too late 
For what 
I've been a fool Don't speak of it 
You're not angry with me Never 
Thank you Gringoire 
I must work to get you free 
What is it Quiet 
I hear somebody talking 
It seems to come from over there 
Look it's Quasimodo 
How can we save her 
How can we save her 
How can we save her 
Here here is the appeal 
Quick Master Fisher Quick 
We'll print it at once 
To the people of Paris 
Not so fast 
I must get the type ready 
Good good 
But who will distribute them 
Let me see 
You may destroy the form but not the spirit 
Parisians mark my words 
Today it is an innocent Gypsy girl 
Parisians let us appeal to the king 
Witness 
Let us this is not a public square 
Close the door 
Silence 
Silence in the court 
Show them the evidence 
Witness does this dagger belong to the Gypsy 
Yes 
Is it the dagger that killed Captain Phoebus 
You know she's innocent 
These witnesses have proved it 
Sit down 
Silence 
Silence in the court 
Bring in the other prisoner 
Silence 
Silence in the court 
Now the witchcraft is proved 
I protest in the name of commonsense 
Remove the witness 
Do you still deny that Satan is your master 
I am innocent 
It wasn't her 
If you want to know who it was it was me 
Silence in the court 
Silence 
Do you confess now 
I am innocent 
Proceed 
The court will adjourn 
What do you think 
She'll confess under torture 
They all do I hate to see her hang 
Is the doctor here Yes 
Proceed 
Mercy 
Mercy 
Mercy 
Your Honor 
No no 
Let's stay back here 
Silence 
Silence in the court 
Your Honor the prisoner has confessed all 
What is he saying 
He's demanding the death penalty 
We will now take the vote 
Wait 
What's this 
Blood 
Did you confess under torture 
Yes but I am innocent 
I'll find out 
Untie her 
Come here 
Let us submit her to trial by ordeal 
Is this the dagger found in her hand 
Here is my dagger 
If you touch yours you will be judged guilty 
If you touch mine you will be innocent 
Blindfold her 
Choose 
The judgement is against you 
I'm sorry 
May God have mercy on your soul 
You've been kind to me 
I kneel before you innocent of crime 
I believe you 
Then she will hang without public penance 
You won't dare 
She is a witch and must die 
Take her away 
Sanctuary sanctuary 
Sanctuary sanctuary 
Thank heaven the sanctuary will save her 
Sanctuary 
But she's my wife 
I must see her 
Not now 
Believe me she is safe here 
He did once before That was not his fault 
Eat eat 
Come here 
You called me back 
I'm 
I'm deaf you know 
But I'm deaf too 
It's horrible 
I never realized till now how ugly I am 
Because you're so beautiful 
I'm not a man 
I'm not a beast 
I'm about as shapeless as the man in the moon 
Why did you save me 
You asked me why I saved you 
Listen 
And that would kill me 
Yes 
It's good in the church 
It's high high up 
Look 
People 
Look little people 
Look look 
Here 
Up here friends 
Up there babies 
Jacqueline 
Gabrielle 
Guillaume 
Big Marie 
She made me deaf you know 
I can hear my friends 
Shall I play them for you 
I am proud to be the first to sign 
I never heard of such an outrage 
Your signature 
I have something to say to you 
What is it my child 
Look at that new weapon With this we save her 
Don't bother me now 
I've got to finish this appeal to the king 
To the people 
The printer's waiting Words won't save her 
I have a better way: force 
I don't believe in force 
What do you want 
To prove your point or save Esmeralda 
Do something Right 
No wait Until they hang Esmeralda 
No no no Clopin 
We must wait What for 
But you forget the power of nobility 
You forget that the king will read this too 
I can't depend on pamphlets 
We march 
Get ready 
Throughout the whole country sire 
My craftsmen are awakening 
The result of your printing press sire 
If we had taken Read on read on 
The people have faith in their king 
he will refuse the nobles' demand 
to suspend the sanctuary of Notre Dame 
What's that 
Why are they gathering out there 
What does all this mean 
It's the pamphlet sire 
I see 
I see 
This poet is cleverer than I thought 
Impertinent but I like it 
It's different 
Public opinion is dangerous sire 
Dangerous for whom 
Have you read this 
I have sire 
Go on 
Destroy these false nobles who want to be kings 
Hang pillage sack them 
On my people on 
What do you mean 
That I would not endure 
It's all your fault 
My fault 
Yes 
But sire the Gypsy girl is innocent 
The trial by ordeal was against her 
Still she is innocent 
Who is it 
Speak up 
Your Majesty 
Who is it you are protecting 
I am waiting for my brother to speak 
Who is it 
It's the Hunchback No 
Then who is it 
Who is the murderer 
I did it and I would do it again 
I don't understand 
He's madly in love with the Gypsy girl 
And he condemned her to death 
Because she didn't love him 
Who are you 
Maitre Gringoire 
Quick quick 
Come in come in 
What's all this about 
Who are you 
Citizens of Paris 
No one shall violate it 
Not even the nobles 
Not even the nobles 
I don't believe you 
Charge 
People 
They've come to hang you 
No one can get in here 
I wouldn't let them 
If you are afraid pull the rope 
I can hear the bell 
What's the matter 
Are you all cowards 
She's one of us 
Come on fight 
You're not afraid of a stick of wood are you 
Where's your courage beggars 
Come on we'll save her 
Set her free 
Come on 
Fight 
Don't slink away like frightened rats 
What are you afraid of 
There's no demon up there 
That's only Quasimodo the bellringer 
Come on lads do your work 
Come on lads 
Forward 
Forward lads 
Parisians 
Parisians she's free 
We won 
The king has pardoned her 
Disperse and go your ways in peace 
We've won 
Why didn't you wait 
I told you I could save her without using force 
I thought that was just a poet's dream 
Don't thank me 
Thank Quasimodo who saved you from hanging 
Your Grace 
Why was I not made of stone like thee 
A man has committed murder

You are alike 
He has one twinkly eye and one a little sad 
You're right

The Riviera's lovely 
Ever been 
No I've been told about it so I know a little 
Casinos 
Mimosa 
You and your casinos and mimosa 
It's an airy fairy dream 
Maybe but sometimes it's so drab here 
Because you live alone 
But ifyou lived with me 
You're so nice 
Of course I am 
Don't laugh 
Lilac 
What's wrong 
I pricked my finger 
Let me see 
It's nothing 
Want me to stay 
I'd leave early 
No one would see me 
Not tonight 
Why 
Don't you like me 
Yes but I have an appointment 
At this time of night 
They let you go out 
Everyone is asleep 
I can go 
I'm in charge ofthe house 
In charge 
You're not jealous 
Not at all 
You're a free agent 
So am I 
We all are 
Let me know ifyou want to see me again 
I'll take him with me 
Oh no 
Why not 
I don't like leaving empty handed 
Clever 
I did it on purpose 
Valentin knows his stuff 
A better trainer doesn't exist 
He was here before 3 months ago 
The swine 
Women are fools but I top the lot 
Just tell me when your housework's done 
Housework 
What's it got to do with me 
You don't know how happy I am this evening 
Freedom is quite something 
You're not very friendly 
You could offer me a drink 
OK what'll you have 
He has a way of using his hands 
As though he kept his spell up his sleeve 
He can talk you into anything 
Take the Riviera for instance 
That's how he got me with mimosa 
What's the matter 
Nothing 
You could say something nice to me 
What 
That you're beautiful 
I can't tell with all that make up 
I take it off before I go to bed 
You've got blue eyes 
They're quiet and restful 
At least you don't talk much 
Shall I say I love you 
I'm sick of men who talk of love 
I'm not so absent minded 
Hey you're not going to desert me now 
I'm old enough to go home alone 
You're not angry 
But my evening's spoilt 
What's one evening at your age 
See you tomorrow 
But quitting the act 
The act 
We leave tomorrow 
Steady the lady's with me 
Temporarily 
Not at all 
It's for life isn't it 
What's your name 
Mine's Clara 
You're ridiculous 
You're the one who's ridiculous and rude 
Ifyou think vulgarity settles the matter 
Sailing dates 
Ships due at Boulogne 
Sailing dates 
It's all very sad 
The cat 
I wonder what he's doing now all alone 
It can't be much fun 
No it can't be 
It gives you the creeps 
Where can I sleep 
I can't afford a hotel 
You can't do it 
François isn't a crook 
He's just an ordinary man 
You can't kill him 
He must've moved a wardrobe 
That's all we need 
Hey you down there 
What 
Is there a wardrobe in the room 
What 
I asked ifthere was a wardrobe in the room 
Of course there is 
A big one 
Big 
How should I know 
It's just a wardrobe 
Just a wardrobe 
Made of solid oak or something 
Like any other wardrobe 
Everything all right 
We've got to make the best of it 
Everything all right 
We've got to make the best of it 
Come in 
Are you alone 
Silly 
Of course I am as you never come near me 
It's Sunday today Complaints are not accepted 
You look lovely 
Truth rising from out the well 
The truth 
Careful 
or I'll tell you a few home truths 
Not this morning I'm not curious 
I'm in love 
In love 
What next I wonder 
I've been here 2 months now 
Why 
And for whom 
A brute like you 
But I'm a nice brute aren't I 
You must admit I travel light 
That's the trouble 
You never bring your things 
That was never intended 
I know 
You promised nothing and I asked for nothing 
All the same 
I get bored at night 
Can't sleep 
I can 
Well 
I have nightmares 
And you're not there so it doesn't help 
Call that a love life 
Love life indeed 
You're silly 
But I slave away all day 
I need my sleep at night 
But during the day it depends 
Sunday morning for instance 
Doesn't the light worry you 
The winter sun is kind 
I prefer a bit of shade 
Well I say 
What's up 
Look 
The trainer 
What a time to choose What's he want 
Nothing good 
He's come to see you 
More likely come to see her 
I told you never to mention her 
He won't hesitate to do so 
What's he doing all this time 
What's he doing 
Well isn't that nice 
I listen at keyholes 
But I've no principles 
Does that shock you 
So they've something to hide 
I always was very intelligent 
Can I help that 
I hope I'm not disturbing you 
I can see you're so happy together 
Mind I'm not jealous 
I'm a nomad 
Here today gone tomorrow 
Have you finished your oration 
What do you want 
I don't know 
I just dropped in 
It's amusing 
I'm back like a ghost 
Like to see the dogs 
Women forget quickly 
Poor little creatures 
Not women the dogs 
You can't make us jump through the hoop 
Come to the point 
What do you want 
He wants to talk to you 
And you want to talk to him 
You'd better go 
He'll go with you 
What you've got to say doesn't concern me 
You know Clara it hurt me when you left me 
Hurt you 
Really 
You must be growing old 
You're growing old 
Coming 
Hang on 
What'll it be gentlemen 
Glass ofwhite wine 
We can't stay here forever 
You're back for Françoise 
For instance that you're still chasing her 
None ofyour bloody business 
You can't avoid explanations by vulgarity 
Explanations 
That's right 
I've tolerated your affair with Clara 
I could have put a stop to it 
But I let it go 
I'm broad minded 
Maybe but your brain's too tiny 
So ideas just tumble out anyhow 
First it's Françoise then Clara 
You're muddled headed tired 
Clara's free to do as she likes 
But Françoise 
It's time I told you something 
Try me 
I'm interested in her 
Because she is my daughter 
It may seem odd but it's a fact 
Françoise is my daughter 
She's an orphan 
Children from orphanages don't have parents 
I'll be honest with you 
You see before you a poor wretch 
I have my faults like all men 
My vices too 
But at heart I'm no worse than another 
I did wrong I admit it 
As for her mother 
we mustn't be too hard on her 
When we had this child I was young 
I didn't understand A youthful peccadillo 
Ajoke 
It haunts you 
You'll never know how I searched 
I checked and rechecked 
When I saw her the image of her mother 
What a woman she was 
A beauty 
The same green eyes continually changing 
What a world 
It's a small world 
We each go our way 
It's my duty to intervene 
Your duty 
Duty 
Forgive me but I want only one thing: 
the child's happiness 
It's a simple natural reaction 
And frankly she can't be happy with you 
You're unbelievable 
There's no other word for it 
Playing the father 
What a nerve 
To do what I ask you 
To moralize 
What ajoke 
Listen 
I'll tell you something: 
I come from an orphanage too 
And if my father or mother dared preach to me 
I'd tell them off 
Anyway what's it all got to do with me 
I love Françoise do you hear 
What do you say to that 
You do 
Yes 
And her 
Never you mind 
After all my dear fellow think 
A right 
I'm fed up with you 
What do you hope for 
Tell me that 
You wouldn't 
You don't hope to 
Not Françoise 
I have a responsibility to her 
You have no money no future and bad health 
What 
What did you say 
You're lucky you're her father 
Now listen 
Get up and go 
Go quietly 
Hop it 
Get me 
It's odd 
What 
We meet every day but you live with her 
You know I don't live with her 
It's the same thing 
Not at all 
Do you love Clara 
No I want to live with you 
Would you like that 
We'd be happy 
Or rather someone 
Someone 
Come You know who I mean 
So you're still jealous 
It's not jealousy 
What 
That he's your father 
My father 
But he's not my father 
He's not 
No 
He loves making up stories 
You should have heard his yarn 
He's mad 
What does he want 
And why do you go on seeing him 
I told you He's been kind to me 
He brings me presents he writes to me 
The picture postcards 
He's traveled and knows a lot 
He hasn't and he knows nothing 
He's a maniac and a liar 
He makes me sick 
Ifyou'd heard him: 
My daughter this my daughter that 
I tell you he's nuts 
I won't see him again ifyou want 
Really 
And I won't see Clara again 
Don't you hate a guy who lies all the time 
We all lie I've lied myself 
It'd be a lie to say I hadn't 
I don't like liars 
I'm not a confirmed liar 
I love you so you can't be 
It's nice here 
Remember what you said 
What 
We'd pick lilac at Easter 
Haven't you enough flowers here 
They're hot house plants not like the country 
The country's so lovely 
I do love you 
The first time I saw you 
I knew what happiness meant 
I love you 
It's sweet ofyou to say so 
I'm happy and I feel like laughing 
I don't understand it 
I don't like pain 
Pain 
D'you think I do 
But we two will be happy 
I've never been happy before 
When I was alone I didn't care 
I've always been unlucky 
Unlucky in all kinds ofways 
Same old story 
That's bad for you too 
It's like sandblasting 
After a bit I had to give up 
Things were going badly I set up on my own 
It's like waiting for a tram in the rain 
It doesn't stop 
It's full up 
And so is the second and third 
You stand there waiting 
Like a fool 
But now I've got you 
You want to keep me for always 
Of course 
Do you love me 
This is for me 
I really care for it I've always worn it 
Do you love me 
Yes I love you 
There's nothing to explain 
I knew it when you walked in 
You looked like an undertaker 
I'm not in the mood forjokes 
What about me 
But it's not a tragedy 
Luckily we're not in love 
You angry 
Why 
I've been very happy with you 
We were too far apart 
Don't pull such a face 
I'm not pulling a face 
You are 
You'd think I was dropping you 
So sensitive so touchy 
You all make me laugh 
What'll you do now 
Look for ajob I know people in the business 
I once worked for a seal trainer 
Are seals nice 
The trainer was nice too to me 
He was brutal to the seals 
I left him to join Valentin 
He used gentle methods 
He trained a dog in 3 days D'you know how 
Enough 
He's disgusting 
And mad 
He's not mad He's rotten Like a bruised fruit 
He knows it 
So he hurts others as consolation 
He destroyed something in me too 
Still I mustn't grumble 
I had a break with you a rest cure 
I didn't want to hurt you 
I want you to remember me as a friend 
I shan't forget you 
If I could I'd forget you at once 
Memories 
Do I look as if I live on memories 
But I'll give you something 
A present to remember me by 
What 
Valentin gave it to me Shocked 
He had a stock ofthem 
I took them to make him buy more 
Like to see them 
Nothing easier 
It's a scoop 
A bargain 
They're very pretty from Italy 
Here 
Look 
Aren't they nice 
All his mistresses get one 
She has one too hasn't she 
What are you staring at 
What are you all waiting for 
Has he gone mad 
He'll jump 
What's up 
He's at the window 
What 
I'm not a freak What are you waiting for 
You expect me to jump 
A murderer's interesting 
I'm a murderer yes 
Everyone kills Everyone 
Like the sand that gets into you 
Beat it 
Go home and read about it in the papers 
It'll all be in print 
You'll read it and believe it 
What else are the newspapers for 
They know everything 
Beat it or you'll catch cold 
Scram 
Let me alone 
Alone d'you hear 
All I ask is to be left in peace 
I'm so tired 
I don't trust anyone anymore It's all over 
Give up François 
Others have killed and are alive 
Come on down 
Go after it 
It's a piece of luck 
François come down There's hope 
Who is François 
I don't know him 
He doesn't exist anymore 
So leave me in peace 
Go away 
We all know you You're a good chap 
Don't be stubborn 
We'll stand by you 
Come down 
What now 
We wait We have orders 
Clear the square 
She fell She must've hit her head 
We can't leave her here 
Take her to my room 
Where are you going 
She's hurt 
This is no clinic 
What d'you want 
I must talk to you man to man 
Beat it 
I won't go till you've heard me out 
I've listened enough to you Get out 
Françoise won't see me 
I know you put her up to it 
Then why ask me 
You're lucky 
I am 
Am I 
Deceived 
A laughing stock 
What a lucky man 
You had a good laugh with Clara 
I don't care I've no false pride 
But what are you up to with Françoise 
Don't start again 
I was about to turn in 
I work all day and every day see 
So I set my alarm and get to bed 
Get out 
I'm unhappy 
Who cares 
Aren't I 
No you're not 
I did spin a yarn the other night 
I'm not her father 
Are you shocked 
You're revolting 
I've imagination I'm a dreamer 
I invent exactly what I like 
I couldn't bear that she 
Stop fidgeting 
You're like a cornered rat 
So keep still 
Keep still dammit 
I haven't moved 
It's odd 
I thought that manual workers had no nerves 
Shut up 
You're on the edge 
Because you're uneasy 
Because you can't understand certain things 
Women are so complicated 
And girls so mysterious 
I'll make you shut up 
I'll make you 
You don't scare me Hah 
Laugh away 
Go ahead and laugh 
If I threw you out you'd laugh 
Stop it 
You're crazy 
I'll let you go but it's a pity 
It's silly I feel all dizzy 
Dizzy 
I feel dizzy all the time 
It's not so easy to kill a man 
I know something about it 
That's what I came to do 
Yes I wanted to kill you 
Just an idea I had 
I'm ajoke 
A rotter 
Yes you are 
For tuppence I'd burst into tears 
What a man I was once though 
Everyone liked me 
Disgusting 
Disgusting 
Well why not 
It has its advantages 
You aren't 
You're honest straightforward and trusting 
What a fine thing trust is 
This is nice too 
A pretty trinket 
A pretty present for a little girl 
What d'you mean 
What do you want to know 
Nothing 
Hold your tongue 
Love 
Romance 
Of course they love you 
It's wonderful to be loved eh 
They don't love me but I attract them 
That's the whole secret 
And as I attracted her she and I 
Silly of me 
I adore youth 
Interested 
Like to hear more 
Shut your trap will you 
Will you shut your trap 
You did yourself a lot of good 
You too 
Gas 
Where is he 
What have they done to him 
I love you 
Don't move 
Try to sleep 
I shouldn't have said I loved him 
He's changed he's not the same 
Explanations always explanations 
We love each other François 
I trust you 
Not so loud 
She's feverish What is it 
Gas 
They're not going to suffocate him 
No it's tear gas 
The sand has made him used to it 
What does it matter 
He doesn't love Clara That's all 
He can't help not loving her 
You love me François 
Don't excite yourself try to sleep 
I can't get up 
You remember what you said 
What 
At Easter we'll pick lilac 
THE RULES OF THE GAME 
A Dramatic Fantasy 
Its characters are purely fictitious 
Sensitive hearts faithful hearts 
Who shun love whither it does range 
Cease to be so bitter 
Is it a crime to change 
If Cupid was given wings 
Was it not to flitter 
Crossing the Atlantic in 23 hours 
A record comparable 
Watch the cord 
The crowd's moving 
It's really the plane's doing 
Not at all 
It's a fine achievement 
Octave 
André 
Am I ever happy 
Not about your flight 
It's you I'm glad to see 
It is you isn't it 
Is she here 
She didn't come 
She didn't come 
She couldn't make it 
But I did this all for her 
I know 
Just a few words 
What can I say 
You just flew solo over the Atlantic 
You must have something to say 
Anything 
You must be happy 
I'm very unhappy 
I've never been so disappointed in my life 
I made this flight for a woman 
She's not here to welcome me 
She didn't even bother 
I tell her this publicly: 
She's disloyal 
The great aviator has performed a stunning feat 
My purse Lisette 
He can't really talk 
If Christine won't see you serves you right 
I couldn't face her now 
Get some sleep first 
Almost two years Madame 
That's true 
How time flies 
Are you happy 
My husband's no trouble 
He's in service at the château and I'm in Paris 
With you Madame I'm very happy 
Do you have lovers 
That's a big word 
Of course you do 
Octave for example 
Give me my evening lipstick 
I don't know where it is 
Oh yes you do 
I don't like it 
Too purple 
It doesn't look natural 
What's natural nowadays 
And your lovers 
What do they say to you 
Not much 
Do they kiss you 
If I let them 
Do they hold your hand 
It depends 
And then what 
Then what 
Same old story: 
The more you give the more they want 
My scarf 
Nothing doing 
Men are all the same 
What about friendship 
Friendship with a man 
When pigs have wings 
Good evening Madame 
Good evening Lisette 
Mitzi 
Yes Madame 
Did you take the dogs out 
Yes Madame 
Where is Monsieur 
In his study 
Calm has returned to Le Bourget airfield 
The crowd is breaking up peacefully 
The victory reception is over 
We're late my dear 
As usual 
A new one 
I got it today 
I prefer it to the radio 
So you heard what André Jurieux said 
I can well imagine what he thought 
He'd risked his life 
He mistook it for love 
Men are so naïve 
How happy that makes me 
Thank you 
It's nothing 
Telling lies is such a heavy weight to bear 
Lies 
Don't exaggerate 
Would you call me a liar 
I trust you completely 
Do you 
Excuse me a minute my dear 
Madame de Marras please 
Is that you Geneviève 
I must see you 
Then come over now 
You're going out with Christine 
In the morning then 
Not at 10:00 
Yes 11:00 
Be realistic 
La Chesnaye must be in a state 
So why does he have a wireless 
Progress 
You call that progress 
I call it exhibitionism 
And because you have a crush on her 
An artist's life 
Her father was a famous conductor in Vienna 
Why did she marry 
I didn't 
Oh you 
What's on your mind 
What does he say 
If I understand you right you want to leave me 
I see the family picture: 
Knitting the slippers and lots of children 
Exactly 
I sort of feel now that I've had my fun 
All this because of the radio and André Jurieux 
How perceptive you are 
Let's say we do split up 
What would change with Christine 
Why everything 
Nothing 
She's remained so Austrian 
A Parisian woman would understand Not her 
She'd never forgive you 
I know 
Believe it or not you mean a lot to me 
My dear I'm so sorry 
A good thing you're weak 
I take after my father 
The poor man had such a complicated existence 
Let's go to lunch 
With pleasure 
No old man 
Go on if you want but I'm walking home 
Don't leave me alone 
Damn your problems 
And now you drive us into a ditch 
Thanks but no thanks 
Are you hurt 
I wonder if I'm not dead 
I hit the roof like a feather 
It's rattled my brains 
Want to kill yourself over Christine 
Go ahead but without me 
Understand 
I do 
You're nuts 
So I'm nuts 
Get help and get off my back 
You'd gladly see me put away 
You love her too 
Sure I do in my own way 
So you can't have her like a glass of wine 
Get this: 
She's like a sister to me 
We grew up together 
He was also the best of men 
I never got to show him my gratitude 
Now I can 
So I can and will look after her 
She needs looking after 
Because I love her 
Him and his hunts château and mechanical birds 
A two timing snob 
Your head's in the clouds 
At Le Bourget when you got back 
No wonder she won't see you 
But I did it for her for her alone understand 
She encouraged me So when she didn't show up 
I don't need lectures 
I need Christine 
I love her you know 
If I don't see her again I'll die 
You'll see her again 
Think so 
Sure you will 
Leave it to me 
So Mr Octave 
No hello 
Fresh as a rose 
But you look awful 
What's the matter 
I bet it's your pilot friend again 
What a nuisance 
Madame can't sleep at night 
Listen here 
Do you trust me 
I'll settle it 
Really 
Where have you been 
I've been very busy 
Problems 
I'll tell you later 
You came to see my wife 
Let me say good morning 
What's that you got: 
A nightingale 
A warbler 
Looks like the moths got to it 
But it still sings every 20 seconds 
I bet it does 
Cynic 
Where have you been all this time 
Were you away 
May I 
Good morning my dear 
Sleep well 
Say Lisette 
I got a letter from Shoemaker 
Schumacher 
He wants you to join him 
And leave Madame 
Your lordship I'd rather divorce 
Don't get melodramatic 
Are you two done talking 
Oh yes you have a big secret for her 
You said it 
I'll leave you 
About time too 
Coming out to La Colinière 
Maybe 
What did I say 
Twenty seconds 
A cup of tea 
A nice hot coffee with bread and jam 
I'm not hungry 
Something's definitely out of order 
I've never seen Mr Octave without an appetite 
Won't you sit down 
Come now tell me your secret 
It's about André 
Oh no 
You know he wanted to die 
That's just talk 
Excuse me but I was there 
How could he 
How 
Why in his car 
He tried to drive into a tree 
And it's my fault 
It sure is your fault 
I don't understand 
Don't you 
Listen my dear 
You can do it with me 
You'll always be my little Salzburg girl 
But with others it can be awkward 
So I'm to blame for everything 
Not everything 
Just a few things 
Must I apologize to your friend 
That's going a bit far 
But you might 
invite him to La Colinière 
You're so improper 
In that case 
I'm going 
Good bye 
Or rather farewell 
Where are you going 
To see him 
You won't come out to La Colinière 
I can't cut myself in two 
You silly thing 
You foolish old dear 
So you'll invite him 
I'll invite him 
If his plane crashes they'll blame it on me 
They'll talk about the foreigner 
And I hate martyrs 
And your husband 
what'll you do about him 
That's your business 
I've done my part 
I wash my hands of the rest 
Christine du bist ein Engel 
An angel 
A dangerous angel but an angel nonetheless 
You'll put on weight 
Don't worry 
I'll deal with it 
All right then 
I'll expect you at La Colinière 
You have your own car fine 
See you tomorrow 
I'm in a terrible predicament 
Geneviève 
You know 
Who doesn't 
Sick and tired of her 
But you want to end it 
Leave it to me 
If you could 
Easy enough 
To whom 
To you 
Oh me you know I'm not the marrying kind 
I'd be ready to sacrifice myself 
But only for Christine 
I know 
But I need a favor in return 
You need money 
You know you're a decent guy 
I take after my mother 
I want you to invite André Jurieux 
To La Colinière 
That's a very serious request 
Serious 
I'm not blind 
Nothing happened 
A good thing too 
Then invite him 
I'd be taking a big risk 
I love Christine 
I'd never get over losing her 
You know what 
I feel like skedaddling 
I want to disappear down a hole 
What for 
Of course they do 
And I'm all for their free expression 
I'm against barriers and walls 
And that's why I'll invite André 
Is it the right thing to do 
I have faith in Christine 
You idiot 
That would be way too practical 
I'll get dressed 
Staying for breakfast 
Yes I'm staying 
Your lordship about La Colinière 
See my secretary 
Is Madame bringing her dogs 
Ask Madame 
My screw 
Move this bench away 
I understand sir 
My dear put that on the table 
I have some big news 
The things you dream up 
The things I dream up 
Dream up 
Excuse me 
You know you're no fool you're a poet 
A dangerous poet 
Your lordship 
Excuse me for bringing this up while on duty 
It's about my wife 
You wrote me my friend 
I feel like a widower 
What did his lordship decide 
What's there to decide 
Very good your lordship 
I'm so glad to be here 
So am I 
I lit the stove and stocked all the fireplaces 
Inform Corneille 
How is Gertrude 
Was the coal delivered 
And the wood brought in 
Very good 
Hello Lisette 
Hello Edouard 
Everything all right 
Fine 
Here you are at last 
Yes here I am 
What's that 
What keeps you from doing the same 
Is that all 
With the full moon we kill fewer than usual 
I don't want any fencing 
Yes your lordship 
Nor do I want any rabbits 
Work it out 
May I continue my rounds 
Of course Schumacher 
We'll head towards Foucherolle 
Musette 
Here girl 
What did the boss say 
He doesn't want fencing or rabbits 
How are we supposed to work it out 
It's that pest of a miller's cat 
He's a real nuisance 
He's no nuisance now 
Marceau deserves the same treatment 
Marceau takes us for idiots 
But it won't last much longer 
What'd you find girl 
A rabbit in a snare 
Marceau sets snares all over Leave them 
Don't tip him off 
He won't be by today 
At dawn 
If he goes on a binge he won't be up early 
That bum's got it too easy 
What do we do 
Watch out for him 
There's one 
Hello Marceau 
Hello Schumacher 
How are you 
Want my rabbit 
Give it here 
Go on walk 
Get a move on 
What's going on 
Marceau your lordship 
Marceau who 
Marceau the poacher 
Come here 
We caught him red handed 
Doing what 
Setting snares at woods' edge 
To destroy rabbits 
Why the man's valuable 
Let him go 
Is his lordship serious 
He understands me 
Bully 
I'll teach you manners 
Scum like you should be shot 
Just for a tiny little rabbit 
So your name is Marceau 
Yes your lordship 
You're a poacher 
Actually I mend chairs 
But times are tough even in my line 
His lordship understands me 
So I try to keep busy 
Call that busy 
Back in the war I had men shot for less 
That's enough 
I like your face 
His lordship's kind 
Enough 
His lordship wants to hire me 
I won't say no 
If I poach it's not out of spite 
It's to feed my aging mother 
He has none 
What 
I don't have an aging mother 
Continue your rounds 
Leave me alone 
Say Marceau 
You must have set other snares 
Will you show me one 
This way 
Over here your lordship 
Here's a snare 
It's set in the wrong place 
Why 
This trail isn't used anymore 
I should've noticed 
We all make mistakes 
No it's annoying 
You can count on my discretion 
Thanks your lordship 
So glad to be working for me 
Sure but I'd rather work at the château 
Why 
Don't you like the woods Mother Nature 
With Schumacher around not really 
This is more his world than yours 
At the château he'd have to leave me alone 
I always dreamed of being a domestic 
That's funny 
Why 
Because of the outfit 
I've always dreamed of wearing a uniform 
Has it been raining long 
A half hour 
It was sunny at noon 
Will it last 
Last time it rained for two weeks 
Charming 
Her luggage 
Every time I come out here it rains 
It clears out the mind 
Hello La Bruyère 
Will you allow me 
You're drenched 
Your scarf 
Where's your wife 
With Christine discussing housekeeping 
How interesting 
You came from Tourcoing 
Is it raining there 
Like everywhere else 
It took eight hours to get here via Paris 
The roads are slippery 
A record 
Hello Jackie 
How you've grown 
Think so 
You're studying Chinese right 
No pre Columbian art 
Sounds thrilling 
How are you Charlotte 
Hello my dear 
Have you lost weight 
Watch out for yourself 
I swear 
What about these 
You can't fool me 
Are you playing 
I'll be right in 
Will you join us 
Bridge bores me 
Who mentioned bridge 
Who does your hair Geneviève 
I did 
Do you mind 
On the contrary 
Isn't Jean here 
He drove to Orleans for the fish 
Tell him about Madame La Bruyère's diet 
She eats everything But no salt 
On the contrary 
It's simple 
Even a child would understand 
Do you have sea salt 
No but we'll see to it 
Adolphe for Madame La Plante 
I almost forgot: 
No tea just coffee 
I know: 
Arthritis 
And for André Jurieux 
What do you think of the diphtheria vaccine 
I don't know 
Really 
Find your suitcase 
You can imagine how worried I 
Who's that 
André Jurieux 
The aviator 
What luck 
I'll ask him for an autograph for my eldest boy 
So nice of you to come 
You're very kind 
My dear André This is a pleasure 
It's an honor to have you 
You know everyone 
You haven't met my wife 
She'd like an autograph for our eldest boy 
I hope we'll see you in Tourcoing 
You were magnificent 
Very proud 
You're a man a real man 
It's a vanishing breed 
You didn't fly in 
I must kiss you 
Glad to see you here 
May I kiss you too 
And me 
And me 
I'm entitled to 
It stays in the family 
What's that supposed to mean 
Jurieux and Christine 
What's it to you 
We're here to hunt not to write our memoirs 
So did they or didn't they 
They did 
A pity 
He's so elegant 
Dear friends 
I had a small part to play in his exploit 
This is how 
We spent long hours together 
Very pleasant hours 
Hours marked by the rare sign of friendship 
He told me about his projects and I listened 
It's important to listen 
In this case it wasn't a waste of time 
I'm very proud and I wanted you all to know it 
Aunt I'm so happy 
We'll throw a big party for Jurieux 
Excellent idea 
We'll put on a show 
We'll masquerade 
Sure we'll masquerade 
We'll have as much fun as we can 
When General 
A week from now after the hunt 
Perfect 
Christine let's show him his room 
These young people are charming 
Saint Aubin some billiards 
Yes sir 
Anyone for a game of ping pong 
Me 
Coming Geneviève 
A party for what 
To raise funds for the dispensary 
Your coat madam 
I'll take it off in my room 
He must have a good position 
Most likely 
A perfect match for you Jackie 
André doesn't notice I exist 
A pity the lady of the house 
Did you know she seated him at her right 
What right 
At the table 
That's bad 
Madame can do without your advice 
Asparagus 
Never anything canned 
Only fresh foods for the vitamins 
Pass the mustard 
She can eat like everybody else 
Diets I can accept but not obsessions 
Madame's gone too far over her aviator 
Constraint spoils pleasure 
And you Mr Corneille 
None of your business 
That's not very nice 
Pass the mustard 
Twelve 
I'd still be there if he hadn't gone bankrupt 
Fine but did the countess 
She had no lovers 
Of course not 
You can't compare her to Madame 
Meaning what 
I'm sure your husband agrees 
Right Schumacher 
I don't know what you're talking about 
That's why I quit 
Will you be long Lisette 
Madame still needs me 
But Célestin was afraid of getting burned 
So there you are 
Who do we have here 
I'm looking for Mr Corneille 
Yes my friend 
I'm the new domestic 
His lordship must have told you 
What do you do my good man 
Oh I dunno a bit of everything 
You shine shoes my good man 
Oh sure 
Will do Mr Corneille 
We eat here 
Yes my good man 
I'm on duty now 
Sit down here 
Germaine a plate 
What's your name 
Marceau 
And you mademoiselle 
Madame 
My name's Lisette I'm Madame Schumacher 
Don't let that stop you from sitting down 
The game better be good 
So long as I don't eat rabbit I don't care 
Anything but wild rabbit 
Do I serve rabbit other than paté 
I'm not saying you do 
With a lunch stop 
So it's all set 
A party after the hunt 
What party 
Our party 
A masquerade 
Of course 
Off to bed now 
I'll come check you have everything you need 
As your guests we never lack for anything 
Such hospitality is dying out 
Christine you're the perfect hostess 
This way General 
Before you go I was meaning to ask you 
What's this pre Columbian art 
What are you studying 
American civilization before Columbus's arrival 
Oh Negroes 
There weren't any Negroes yet 
Who was there 
The Indians 
What a goose I am Buffalo Bill 
I forget where my room is 
I'll show you 
We must have a splendid view 
Too bad it's dark 
A hunting horn 
You hunt on horseback 
In my father's day 
Is Octave too noisy 
Not at all 
At the party I'll do a fencing demonstration 
I used to do a card trick 
Whatever you do will be fine 
You're a great musician 
Have fun 
William I won't be needing you tonight 
Good night 
Sleep well 
Good night Sleep well 
You two happy 
Very 
I adore you Charlotte 
My dear I'm so grateful to you 
For what 
For not making me look foolish 
It was delicate in front of everyone 
It was a trying moment and you were admirable 
My compliments 
You can go now 
I won't be needing you now 
Oh no 
Good night Madame 
Don't you want children 
Sure I do Madame 
But they demand a lot of time 
You have to keep after them 
Or else why bother 
That's the beauty of it 
It's your sole preoccupation 
Madame's heard about the new servant 
He's very nice 
His name's Marceau 
Watch out for your husband 
His name's Schumacher 
So my aviator's not all that bad 
You sure smell nice 
Perfume 
Leave me alone 
Something's cooking 
Not in bed yet 
So that's it 
That's what 
It's working out 
Happy 
Delighted 
Now we can put our cards on the table 
But you'd better hide your hand 
And that's a rare thing nowadays 
Sleep well General 
What do you say 
About what 
Everything 
It's going well 
I'm getting the hell out 
Oh no not after all the trouble I went to 
You're here you stay 
Do you like pillows 
I can't stand 'em 
You finished bouncing around 
I thought it was in my range but it was yours 
No it was clearly yours 
No it was past the pine tree 
It was yours my dear fellow 
You're too kind 
You'll have the seventh blind 
Saint Aubin you're his neighbor 
The beaters come from where 
From there 
Then the game will come this way 
At least we'll be upwind 
Madame de Marras 
I know where 
A lot of game try to escape over the road 
You coming with me 
There 
They'll take us for rabbits 
Don't be silly 
That's right the last blind 
Happy being out here 
Very happy 
And far from the chatterers 
What'd they do now 
Disgusting 
They're overdoing it 
They have every right to 
They're married 
I hate her 
Trust my experience 
It'll take a while but you will 
There you're cured 
To wake up I have to fall asleep 
But I can't sleep 
So I've noticed 
You can really be a pain at night 
Ready on the left 
Let's go 
Gentlemen your positions 
Move it on the left 
Move ahead 
Stay close 
Flush 'em out 
Jackie do you enjoy hunting 
Yes Aunt 
Don't you 
I missed them all 
I'm a poor shot today 
You two were talking too much 
Anyway I'm sick of hunting 
Simple enough 
We'll take up winter sports 
Shall we display the kill 
No 
Do that at the château 
That pheasant there on the left 
Sorry sir but this time it's mine 
You can't keep pulling this 
Last time I didn't complain 
Try to understand 
I get a bead on a pheasant and bang 
He shoots it down in front of me 
That's a bit rich 
They have a fine sport in Austria: 
Hunting woodcock 
At night 
At dawn 
I have something to tell you 
Go ahead 
It's a secret 
May I borrow him General 
If you give him back 
Have no fear 
None of that Saint Aubin 
Some people are really clumsy with their guns 
He was dead in 20 minutes 
Wasn't that a good one Christine 
Jackie it's yours 
Where 
I can't see a thing 
But where 
There 
Aim at the rabbit not me 
We lost him 
You're the most deliciously clumsy of women 
Am I 
You are 
I wish I were even clumsier 
Why 
So you'd kiss me more often 
Easy enough 
You know Jackie 
I don't love you 
I know 
But you're wasting your time with my aunt 
So you know 
It's no joke 
You're in pain and so am I 
The field master was lousy 
Mr André shot poorly 
His lordship is a better shot 
You finished kids 
I had no luck despite my position 
It can happen 
Are you cold Madame 
Not when I walk 
A squirrel 
If I only had my gun 
Why 
I'm fond of squirrels 
They're charming but destructive 
Take a look 
How marvelous 
It looks so close I could almost touch it 
Field glasses always come in handy 
This one's small enough to carry 
Fine 
So you'll tell Christine everything 
To what end 
To hurt you 
Charming of you 
I hate suffering alone 
Misery loves company 
And she will if I tell her 
I don't doubt it 
You really love her 
You've stopped loving me 
Let's change the subject 
I'm like the shepherd Paris without the apple 
It's grotesque 
Please give me an answer 
No I don't love you anymore 
I'm very fond of you but 
But I bore you 
The words you come up with my dear 
The right ones 
I give up 
You can fight hatred but not boredom 
Well the whole thing's getting to me too 
I'm leaving 
That would be best 
Yes I'm leaving 
But bid me a tender farewell 
Not farewell Good bye 
No farewell 
But a beautiful farewell 
When Christine didn't exist 
Take me in your arms as you did then 
Come now Geneviève 
Don't say a thing 
Kiss me 
My dear 
Extraordinary 
A moorhen 
You could count its feathers 
Still see it 
No 
Here Madame 
Two feet away from the tree 
Three if we use your feet 
I want to see it too 
Isn't it sweet 
Let me see 
It's my turn 
Very interesting 
'Morning your ladyship 
You're leaving 
Yes I am 
Not staying for our party 
I'm expected in Paris 
You can phone 
No it's better if I go 
Better 
For whom 
For you 
For me then 
My dear Geneviève can we speak frankly 
Am I a troublesome wife 
How could you be troublesome to me 
You know 
Like everyone else 
Good old Robert 
He's so kind so sensitive 
But he's like a child 
He's incapable of hiding a thing 
How true 
When he tries to lie you can tell right away 
He blushes before speaking 
His nose almost starts growing 
He has such tact 
I only have one complaint: 
His habit of smoking in bed 
Isn't it awful though 
And the ashes 
The sheets 
All burnt 
The holes 
As if beds were for smoking 
I ask you 
So you'll stay 
I don't know anymore 
André Jurieux 
Sincere people are such bores 
It depends what for 
What will you wear tonight 
A Tyrolian outfit 
And you 
I didn't prepare anything 
Come with me 
We'll find some fabric 
Do you know any Tyrolian dances 
Wait it must go like this 
No like this 
Unbelievable 
Our shoes have vanished 
My boots are missing 
So are mine 
My wife's shoes are gone 
Corneille will find them 
I'll see to it 
What will you wear tonight 
I thought it over all night 
I'm going to dress as a bear 
Wait 
I left the price tag on 
It's a fine cape 
Warm and waterproof 
But it's not flattering 
Some men require not reputation's yoke 
The eye was in the grave and was watching Cain 
Getting used to your new job 
She loves me 
Loves me not 
Loves me 
Loves me not 
Loves me 
Loves me 
Loves me not 
Loves me 
She loves me 
I hurt you 
On the contrary 
I'm glad Why 
You're close to me 
Silly 
What are you doing here 
I'm on duty 
We're on duty 
The boots my good man 
All the men are waiting 
There's a house revolution 
Don't blame me Blame this big bully here 
Why are you here 
I came to see my wife 
This is hardly the moment 
Their party's tonight 
Off you go 
Stop bothering the staff 
We're busy enough as it is 
See 
You're bothering the staff 
We're a hit 
Encore 
She's so annoying 
Come on 
Author 
Feeling gay we proudly made our way 
Out to the racetrack our hearts unafraid 
Our step was brisk We couldn't risk 
Missing the military parade 
All together now 
Where'd she go 
We must talk 
Where is she 
Who 
Christine 
Dunno 
Help me out of this 
Don't bother me now 
I drank too much 
I don't know what I'm doing 
That's good 
Aren't we playing anymore 
I've had enough of this show 
Why'd I dress up like this then 
Help me out of this bearskin 
We're busy 
Busy 
Help me out of this 
I'm busy 
Have you seen my wife 
I'm looking for her 
I'm dying to play belote 
A two hander 
Ask the general 
Have you seen Madame 
You're a nice fellow but 
But I can't take it off by myself 
Now's not the time 
And Christine 
What've you done with her 
You'll find out soon enough 
Let me just get this off Then they'll see 
Come here 
I'll take your bearskin off 
About time 
Let's leave together 
I live here 
I can't just walk out 
You and your sense of property 
As if a house were that important 
I must see Christine first 
Pull 
You haven't seen me 
Why 
Schumacher's after me 
What for 
On account of his wife 
We were playing around 
He saw us and he's not happy 
Oh your lordship women are charming 
I like them a lot 
Too much in fact 
But they spell trouble 
You're telling me 
You've got it bad too 
Somewhat 
Ever wish you were an Arab 
No 
What for 
For the harem 
They're made like us 
If you say so 
They always have a favorite 
If you say so 
It's the story of my life 
But that takes money 
Even with money I still hurt everybody: 
My wife my mistress and even myself 
Why don't you give it a try 
Because it takes talent 
Naturally 
Would you mind doing me a favor 
Gladly 
What 
Check if the coast is clear 
Use the terrace 
Too much light 
Stay here 
I'll take a look 
Thanks your lordship 
What are you doing here 
Nothing 
You're restricted to the hallways tonight 
Move into my bathroom 
You're needed 
Is it time 
Just about 
Where's Mr Saint Aubin 
I don't know honestly 
Excuse me 
Where's André 
By what right 
Yes by what right 
You're being indiscreet 
Maybe so but this time I demand an explanation 
I refuse to give one 
You can't order Christine around 
Then you'll give me one 
I'll box your ears sir 
Just try sir 
André please 
My dear Christine I'm sorry 
He'll receive my seconds in the morning 
Mornings I sleep 
I may have to throw them out 
You won't duel 
Not with you 
You won't live it down 
That's a laugh 
You're putting me in an inferior position 
You mustn't fight 
I'm going to break that clown's neck 
Clown 
Stay out of this 
So I'm a coward 
See to Saint Aubin 
Why weren't you at Le Bourget 
Because 
I love you André 
I never wanted to admit it 
But now I have a right to tell you 
I love you 
This is wonderful 
I'd given up hope 
What are we going to do 
We'll go away 
Where 
Anywhere 
When 
Right away 
I love you Christine 
I think I can make you happy 
I've dreamed only of the joy of being with you 
So I know 
this joy doesn't come as a surprise 
Are you afraid 
I must tell La Chesnaye 
What for 
It's only proper that I do 
Listen to me 
Even so Christine there are still rules 
We went and kicked up our heels 
We went and kicked up our heels 
I think you'll like it 
I'll let you decide 
One 
Two 
Music 
If he bothers you come and get me 
I'll put him in his place and fast 
What are you doing here 
I came down for an apple 
Where's Marceau 
Am I his keeper 
Where you going 
Upstairs with the others 
Get me a drink 
I'm leaving tomorrow and you're coming with me 
Whatever you say Edouard 
I'll take you to Alsace 
Of course 
To hell with their money 
Stop it 
Do you hear me 
Let go 
Let go Lisette 
For the last time 
Do you hear me 
I won't say it again 
We must walk out with our heads high 
You'll thank me later 
Sorry Madame 
I'll murder you 
Well now 
Mr Jurieux 
You have what you wanted 
You're stealing my wife 
No just give me five minutes 
I'll give you this bastard 
Repeat that 
What's going on 
Let's get out of here 
Hold on 
Thief 
Are you crazy 
I've had enough 
What is it 
I just told your friend that I love him 
Well it's about time 
You really love him 
I don't know anymore 
Already 
What'd he do to you 
He kept talking about propriety 
What did you expect 
Poor little Christine 
There's one thing you forget: 
You see he's a hero 
I'll have his hide 
You're crazy 
I've had it 
I'll break your neck 
Was that a bullet 
A bullet 
From a gun 
From a gun 
A bullet from a gun 
Does that surprise you 
Christine disappeared 
Christine disappeared 
Tonight 
Christine disappeared 
So it goes 
You fools 
Didn't you see her leave with Octave 
I don't blame her 
If you two think you're any fun 
Don't worry 
You'll find her someday 
Geneviève please 
When are we leaving 
This isn't the moment 
I have other worries 
Your father walked by without even a look 
And we hid behind a door 
The musicians were already on their feet 
And out there the audience was applauding 
The old atmosphere 
Sure was 
The setting was strange 
And your father what elegance 
He crossed the stage oblivious to everything 
The house went wild 
The king here 
As hard as he could 
He took his baton from the first violin 
As usual 
And just like in a dream 
Leave me alone 
You dirty louse 
Let go 
Not another attraction 
This is too much 
Enough is enough 
I hate gunshots 
That will do Schumacher 
Get off my back 
What 
André please help me calm her down 
Corneille put an end to this farce 
Which one your lordship 
Schumacher and company 
Right away 
You were standing here 
Yes Madame 
And I have to thank you 
Thank you 
Don't mention it 
What's the dose 
Two 
Give me four 
Sleeping pills 
I hate sleeping pills 
Be reasonable 
Where are you going 
To dance 
You can dance in bed 
Yes my love 
I'm going to bed 
Yes darling I'm going to bed 
You really need it 
Go back to your room 
I'm asking you go back inside 
Calm down my dear 
We'll see each other tomorrow 
Good night 
The general 
Cigarette 
Turning in so soon General 
Yes I'm turning in 
I wanted to pay my respects to Christine 
Where is she 
A headache 
Turning in because of that incident 
Not at all 
A slight dispute 
Of course 
Good night 
Where's Christine 
Something must be wrong 
She was tired and turned in 
Really 
And Geneviève 
A bit weary that's all 
She's so sensitive 
The staff was a bit excited tonight 
They're entitled to some fun too 
We thought it was an act 
Had I known I would have stopped him 
It's all right 
Sleep well 
My respects to your wife 
Kiss her for me 
Going already 
It's early yet 
Can't we see Christine 
She's resting 
Great evening 
We once danced a farandole 
Charming but so old fashioned 
Of course 
Good night 
Just a minute 
Was there a lot of damage 
Was anyone injured 
I just did an inspection 
None of the guests were hurt 
Not to mention the glassware 
I have no choice but to dismiss you 
When must I leave 
Straightaway 
At once 
Corneille will pay you some compensation 
I never want to hear your name again 
You're coming with me 
I'm going to Madame 
To say good bye to her 
I told you before 
If Madame still wants me I'm staying 
Isn't it excessive 
Do as I say 
Very well 
Come with me 
My good man I have to ask you to leave too 
It'd be immoral you understand 
I understand 
No hard feelings 
You tried to help me up by making me a domestic 
I'll never forget that 
Don't try to soften me up 
Just go 
I've enough troubles as it is 
What a night 
Where were we 
I asked you for five minutes 
Granted 
How good of you 
But you have quite a right hook 
You're too kind 
Where can we talk 
In the dining room 
Yes of course 
But first accept my apologies 
You don't have to 
You must 
I behaved like a real roughneck 
I was no better 
It ends in a stabbing 
I never believed such things happened 
But they do 
I have an excuse 
I love Christine 
And I don't 
I love her so much I want her to leave with you 
Since her happiness depends on it 
But I'm glad it's with someone from our set 
But still something bothers me 
What 
Your profession 
What about it 
Christine has a certain lifestyle 
You're young and famous 
You could have an accident 
What optimism 
One has to consider it 
What would your financial situation be 
What peace after all that noise 
Are they all gone 
Looks like it 
Good 
I must talk to you about André again 
You have to understand 
It's the plight of all heroes today 
In the air they're terrific 
Clumsy as children 
That's how they are 
Look at the moon with its halo 
It will rain tomorrow 
I was looking for you 
I was worried 
Why 
You're not mad at me 
Not at all 
It's not our fault if men are all mad 
So I can stay 
Of course 
I'm so happy 
Come inside 
You can't be out like this on a November night 
But it began before your marriage 
At a summer resort 
You see 
Everybody knew 
And you never said a word 
We didn't want to hurt you 
Obviously 
And suddenly I understood 
That's also part of the times 
Today everyone lies 
Let's go for a walk 
I'll get your coat 
I'm too warm 
That's because you're not well 
Take my cape 
It's not very fancy but you won't catch cold 
You up the creek 
So am I 
Did you see her again 
Me neither 
She said she'd stay with Madame 
With Madame 
She's not married to you but to Madame 
What'll you do now 
Back to your poaching 
What's it to you now that he threw you out 
You must have poached a few pheasant yourself 
A few rabbits 
I have an idea 
I'm gonna get myself a license as a game dealer 
If a cop stops me What've you got there 
I say In my basket 
Good day Officer 
Have a cigarette 
And you 
What'll you do now 
I'll stay in the area 
Because of my wife 
I want her back 
What are you doing 
Spitting in the water 
It's all I know how to do in life 
Come now 
What's the matter 
Nothing 
A leech 
But you know how when I was young 
I also thought my day would come 
It must be an overwhelming feeling 
To think that I missed out on it 
But it takes a drink 
But after that comes the fall 
You have a rough time but you get used to it 
Beautiful night 
Look at the moon 
Aren't you cold 
No 
What about you 
Put your hood up 
It's Lisette 
With Octave 
The skunk 
You sure it's her 
She's wearing her cape 
The one I gave her 
I'm cold 
Let's go back 
Not to the château 
Never again 
In that case here in the greenhouse 
What are they saying 
I can't hear a thing 
Got your gun on you 
Let him have it 
I used up my bullets on you 
Poor guy 
But my father wasn't like that 
He was a hero too 
A hero in his own way 
Not at all 
You you're a fine fellow 
I'm a failure 
No you're not 
But you need someone to take care of you 
I'll take care of you 
It's too late 
I'm too old 
You fool 
You know it's you I love 
Do you love me 
Yes Christine 
I love you 
Then kiss me 
On the mouth like a lover 
I'll kill them both 
Not her 
Both of them 
I'll get my gun 
You can't 
Not her 
Come with me 
No we stick together 
I'll get your coat 
Where's Christine 
I'm worried 
Don't worry 
She's with Octave 
You can trust him 
After all you met her through him 
I don't blame him 
He's a decent fellow 
Very decent 
I know 
But Octave is someone special 
Where's Madame 
Get her coat 
Her coat 
Very well 
Somebody pinched my hat 
Just great 
This is wrong 
Why wrong 
When it's just for fun it doesn't matter 
Did you find my hat 
And you don't have any money 
Madame needs lots of things 
What will you do without money 
They trampled it 
It's all ruined 
I speak my mind 
You're making a mistake 
Madame won't be happy with you 
Will you take me with you 
Sure 
You'll join us later 
Where's Christine 
She's waiting for you 
Waiting for me 
In the greenhouse over the footbridge 
Bring her this 
Hurry 
In the greenhouse 
You mustn't catch cold 
Thanks so much 
I have to kiss you 
You love her too 
Lisette please 
Am I crying 
I'm suffering and I just hate it 
She's alone 
I'll go talk to her 
Sure let's go 
Not you 
Me 
Listen 
It's him 
Christine 
Did you hear a shot in the park 
In the park 
I was in my room and 
It's André isn't it 
Yes Miss Jackie 
And Madame 
Madame is all right 
Thank you 
Is he dead 
He didn't suffer 
He was hit here 
He dropped like an animal in the hunt 
He called out for Madame and it was over 
Did you shoot him 
It was Schumacher 
But I was in it with him 
Hurry Corneille 
Why didn't you let me go 
What's to become of me now 
Let me go 
Madame needs me 
You're going to give her a kiss 
Give her a kiss and tell her that I left 
She'll understand 
I'll say good bye now to you too 
Good bye 
Good bye Mr Octave 
I was so fond of you 
I was fond of you too 
They need us Corneille 
By the greenhouse 
Where are you headed 
Back to the woods 
And you 
I'm going to Paris 
I'll try to manage on my own 
We may run into each other again someday 
I doubt it 
But you never know 
Anything's possible 
Good luck 
Good luck 
Will you excuse me 
The greenhouse is off limits 
Work out the formalities with Corneille 
I can't bear it 
Be strong Miss Jackie 
People are watching 
I'll take care of her 
Try to get some sleep 
You must be exhausted 
We'll be leaving tomorrow 
I suggest you come inside 
A new definition of the word accident 
And that's become rare my dear Saint Aubin 
That's become rare 
THE END 
These hills here are full of Apaches

Now whoever wants to get out can get out 
Courage courage Reverend

I'll make it warm for that shavetail 
I'll report him to Washington 
Not even protection from the Army 
I don't know what the government is coming to 
America for Americans 
The government must not interfere with business 
Reduce taxes

Over one billion dollars a year 
What this country needs is more fuddle

Oh I never sell her

Aren't we in worse danger here 
Spoken like a man Reverend 
That's common sense 
Don't let my white hair stop you 
Now Curley I haven't said a word

You didn't answer what I asked you last night 
Look Kid why don't you try to escape 
There's a horse out there in the corral 
I gotta go to Lordsburg 
Why don't you go to my ranch and wait for me 
Wait for a dead man 
You haven't got a chance 
It'll be three against one in Lordsburg 
Yeah mine too 
What do you want me to do 
We'd never be safe 
I don't want that kinda life Ringo 
Well I don't see what else I can do 
Go now get away

Now you hush I stood enough of you 
Doctor Boone has settled that for us sir 
Ringo don't stop 
Go on go on Keep riding 
Ringo go on 
Go on 
I'll say you ain't 
Look at them hills 
Apaches 
War signals 
Why don't you take the cuffs off the Kid 
He's mighty handy with a gun 
Can't you drive any faster 
Thick headed lout 
We've got to make that ferry 
Trap brother 
You mean the Apaches 
There's been no sign of them 
You don't see any sign of them 
They strike like rattlesnakes 
You talk too much Gatewood

The law protects folks against dogs that bite 
How about if she keeps him tied up 
He's gentle 
With gentle people that is 
That's for the sheriff to decide 
This order allows me to take him 
Unless you wanna go against the law 
We can't go against the law 
I'm afraid poor Toto has to go

Who me 
Why I'm not a witch at all 
I'm Dorothy Gale from Kansas Oh 
Well is that the witch

Witches are old and ugly 
What was that 
The Munchkins 
They're laughing because I am a witch 
I'm Glinda the Witch of the North 
You are 
Oh I beg your pardon 
Only bad witches are ugly 
from the Wicked Witch of the East 
The little people who live here 
It's all right 
You may all come out and thank her

No that's true 
The Wizard of Oz 
Is he good or is he wicked 
Oh very good but very mysterious 
Did you bring your broomstick with you 
No I'm afraid I didn't 
Well then you'll have to walk 
But how do I start for Emerald City 
It's always best to start at the beginning 
But what happens if I 
Just follow the Yellow Brick Road 
Goodbye 
My 
People come and go so quickly here 
Follow the Yellow Brick Road 
Follow the Yellow 
Now which way do we go 
Pardon me 
That way is a very nice way 
Who said that 
Don't be silly Toto Scarecrows don't talk 
It's pleasant down that way too 
That's funny 
Wasn't he pointing the other way 
Of course people do go both ways 
Why you did say something didn't you 
That's the trouble 
I can't make up my mind 
I haven't got a brain 
Only straw 
How can you talk if you haven't got a brain 
I don't know

You're going to see a wizard 
I couldn't say 
Yes that's true 
But maybe you better not 
Witch

Is my nose bleeding 
Well of course not 
My goodness what a fuss you're making 
You're nothing but a big coward 
You're right I am a coward 
I haven't any courage at all 
I even scare myself 
Look at the circles under my eyes 
I haven't slept in weeks 
Why don't you try counting sheep 
That doesn't do any good 
I'm afraid of them 
Oh that's too bad 
Don't you think the Wizard could help him too 
I don't see why not 
Come along with us 
And him a brain 
He could give you some courage 
I would

where you can tidy up a bit 
Oh thank you so much

I can fairly hear my heart beating 
I'll be home for supper 
In another hour I'll be king of the forest 
Long live the king 
Not nobody not nohow 
Not even a rhinoceros Imposserous 
How about a hippopotamus 
I'd trash him from top to bottom us 
Supposing you met an elephant 
I'd wrap him up in cello phant 
I'd show him who's king of the forest 
How 
How 
Courage 
What makes a king out of a slave Courage 
What makes the flag on the mast to wave 
Courage 
What makes the muskrat guard his musk 
Courage 
What makes the dawn come up like thunder 
Courage 
What puts the ape in apricot 
What have they got that I ain't got 
Courage 
You can say that again 
The Wizard says go away 
Go away 
Looks like we came a long way for nothing 
And I was so happy 
I thought I was on my way home 
Don't cry 
We're gonna get you to the Wizard 
We certainly are 
Running away and hurting her feelings 
Professor Marvel said she was sick 
She may be dying and it's all my fault 
I'll never forgive myself

The great and Oz has spoken 
Who are you 
I am the great and powerful Wizard of Oz 
You are 
I don't believe you

There's no other Wizard except me 
You humbug Yeah 
Yes that's exactly so 
I'm a humbug 
You're a very bad man 
Oh no my dear I'm a very good man 
I'm just a very bad wizard 
And the courage you promised Cowardly Lion 
But they have one thing you haven't got 
A diploma 
the honorary degree of Th 
D 
Th 
D 
That's Doctor of Thinkology 
Oh joy Rapture 
I've got a brain 
How can I thank you enough 
Well you can't 
You're confusing courage with wisdom 
And they have no more courage than you have 
But they have one thing that you haven't got 
A medal 
You are now a member of the Legion of Courage 
Shucks folks I'm speechless 
But I still want one 
They are called phil 
Good deed doers 
And their hearts are no bigger than yours 
But they have one thing you haven't got 
A testimonial 
Ah 
It ticks 
Listen 
Look it ticks 
Read what my medal says Courage 
Ain't it the truth 
Ain't it the truth 
Oh they're all wonderful 
Hey what about Dorothy 
Yes how about Dorothy 
Yeah Dorothy next 
You force me into a cataclysmic decision 
Oh will you 
Could you 
But are you clever enough to manage it 
Child you cut me to the quick 
Weren't you frightened 
I was petrified 
My friends 
I mean my friends 
Obey them as you would me 
Come back Toto 
Don't go without me I'll be right back 
Stop that dog 
This is a highly irregular procedure 
This is absolutely unprecedented 
Come back Come back 
Don't go without me 
Please come back 
I can't come back 
I don't know how it works 
Goodbye folks 
Goodbye 
Oh now I'll never get home 
Stay with us then Dorothy 
We all love you 
We don't want you to go 
Oh Scarecrow what am I going to do 
Look 
Here's someone who can help you 
Will you help me 
Can you help me 
You don't need help any longer 
Then why didn't you tell her before 
Because she wouldn't have believed me 
She had to learn it for herself 
What have you learned Dorothy 
I think that it 
Is that right 
That's all it is 
But that's so easy 
I should've thought of it for you 
I should've felt it in my heart 
She had to find it out for herself 
Toto too 
Toto too 
Now 
Whenever you wish 
Oh dear 
That's too wonderful to be true 
It's gonna be so hard to say goodbye 
I love you all too 
Goodbye Tin Man 
Oh don't cry 
You'll rust so dreadfully 
Goodbye 
Goodbye Lion 
I think I'll miss you most of all 
Are you ready now 
Say goodbye Toto 
Yes I'm ready now 
There's no place like home 
There's no place like home 
There's no place like home 
There's no place like home 
Wake up honey There's no place like home 
Dorothy dear It's Aunt Em darling 
Oh Auntie Em it's you 
Yes darling Hello there 
Anybody home 
Well she seems all right now 
She got quite a bump on the head 
We kind of thought she was gonna leave us 
But I did leave you That's just the trouble 
And I tried to get back for days 
There there lie quiet now 
You just had a bad dream Sure 
Remember me your old pal Hunk 
And me Hickory 
You couldn't forget my face could you No 
But it wasn't a dream 
It was a place 
And you and you and you and you were there 
But you couldn't have been could you 
We dream lots of silly things when we 
No Aunt Em this was a real truly live place 
And they sent me home 
Doesn't anybody believe me 
Of course we believe you Dorothy 
But anyway Toto we're home 
Home 
And this is my room and you're all here 
How do you do 
Which I think is all to the good 
First is the kind that tells a definite story 
They might be oh just masses of colour 
There's nothing left of him but the title 
A legend about a sorcerer who had an apprentice 
Well this worked very well at first 
My congratulations sir 
Congratulations to you Mickey 
Gee thanks 
Goodbye 
And they certainly were all of that 
They were not very bright 
In any case the dinosaurs were wiped out 
That is where our story ends 
And now we'll have a 15 minute intermission 
He's very shy and very retiring 
All right Come on 
That's all right Don't be timid 
Atta soundtrack 
Go on don't be nervous Go ahead Any sound 
Well that isn't quite what I had in mind 
Suppose we hear and see the harp 
Now one of the strings say the violin 
And now now one of the Woodwinds a flute 
Very pretty 
Now let's have a brass instrument the trumpet 
Go on Go on Drop the other shoe will you 
Thanks a lot old man

Take a beating 
We was out of food

There was a time we was on the land 
There was a boundary to us then 
Old folks died off and little fellas come 
We was always one thing 
We was the family 
Kind of whole and clear 
But now we ain't clear no more 
There ain't nothing that keeps us clear 
Uncle John's just dragging around 
We're cracking up Tom 
There ain't no family now

Twenty days' work Oh boy 
We ain't got it till we get it 
What's the matter Ma 
Getting scared 
Scared Ha 
I ain't never gonna be scared no more 
Like nobody was friendly no more 
Made me feel kind of bad and scared too 
Like we was lost and nobody cared 
You're the one that keeps us going Ma 
I ain't no good no more and I know it 
Thinking of home 
I ain't never gonna see it no more 
Well Pa a woman can change better than a man 
A man lives sort of well in jerks 
Baby's born or somebody dies and that's a jerk 
He gets a farm or loses it and that's a jerk 
A woman looks at it that way 
Maybe but we're sure taking a beating 
I know 
That's what makes us tough 
But we keep coming We're the people that live 
They can't wipe us out They can't lick us 
At the end of the World War Tomainia weakened 
Range: 95 452

Take charge of that gun 
The enemy Quick lift my hand to the throttle 
We'll fool 'em 
Hold on to these dispatches 
If we get them to General Schmelloffel 
Tomainia may yet win 
I'm going to faint 
Don't say that 
Sorry 
Where am I 
Don't you know me 
Yes I feel better now 
The blood's returning to my head 
What's below 
The sun 
Shining upwards 
Strange 
How's the gas 
Kept me awake all night 
No the gasoline in the tank 
Almost empty 
We must be nearly there What time is it 
Approximately one minute to twelve 
Strange 
We seem to be defying the laws of gravity 
Water 
Quick I'm going to faint 
Wait a while 
We'll get into trouble if you faint any more 
Just hold it 
I think I 
Now 
Take it 
Something's wrong 
I can't reach it 
It's all gone 
What's the matter 
Belt too tight 
Loosen it 
I'm trying to 
We're upside down 
I know it 
The stick 
Impossible 
There it goes 
We're out of gas 
Well I suppose this is the end Cigarette 
Not now 
I shan't need this any more 
What month is it 
April 
Spring in Tomainia 
How she loves daffodils 
She'd never cut them for fear of hurting them 
It was like taking a life to cut a daffodil 
Sweet gentle Hilda 
A beautiful soul 
She loved animals and little children too 
We've landed 
Dispatches 
Comrade where are you 
The dispatches 
Where are they 
Are you hurt 
Take me to General Schmelloffel 
If we don't deliver these we're defeated 
The war's over What 
We lost 
Hynkel ruled the nation with an iron fist 
Only the voice of Hynkel was heard 
Adenoid Hynkel said 
Democracy is fragrant 
Liberty is odious 
Freedom of speech is objectionable 
Tomainia has the greatest army 
The greatest navy 
But to remain great we must sacrifice 
We must tighten our belts 
Now Herr Garbitsch Minister of the Interior 
A reference to the Jewish people 
We now pause for station identification 
His Excellency is about to descend the stairs 
Your Excellency are you hurt 
Ride in the other car 
He pauses before a woman with a child 
Camera 
The Venus of Today and the Thinker of Tomorrow 
How was it 
The speech 
Very good 
What 
To arouse the people's anger 
You're right 
Things have been quiet in the ghetto lately 
Good morning Mr Jaeckel 
What's good about it 
Conditions could be worse 
If you think so you have a great imagination 
You heard Hynkel's speech 
I heard nothing I've got my own troubles 
You're better off than a lot of people 
What about the barber 
Still in hospital 
He's been there since the war 
Why not rent his barbershop for him 
He won't let me 
A pity it should be idle all these years 
Why worry 
The government will soon take it from him 
Now you said it 
Hannah 
Everyone is full of troubles 
Yeah everyone Look at Hannah poor girl 
A hard worker can't get a job 
Can't earn enough to pay her rent 
What can I do 
I can't throw her out 
You need some more 
Where are you going 
Mrs Shoemaker's laundry 
Aryan 
We're Aryans 
And we go marching by 
Look fellows Tomatoes and potatoes 
I'll take a box home 
Hey the lorry 
Hold it there will you 
You have no right 
Just charge it to my account 
Nice ripe tomatoes 
Why don't some of you do something 
If I were a man I'd show you 
What would you do pretty 
Is the lorry in case someone hits back 
Shut up 
Come and take me You'll get medals for it 
You pick on women and rob defenceless people 
I'll have to do it again 
Pigs 
Patient 33 Yes sir 
An interesting case: 
Amnesia 
Jewish soldier Been here since the war 
He thinks it's only been weeks 
Does he knows what's happened 
He'll have many surprises 
I'm afraid so 
Yes 
Number 33 is gone 
He was to be examined 
But he's disappeared 
Disappeared 
Let him go It isn't a serious case 
There's little we can do for him 
Come on get out of here 
What are you doing 
I don't know 
Leave that alone 
Don't be silly I'm not silly 
I appreciate that 
When you talk to me Hail Hynkel 
Who are you 
That's my shop 
I don't care if it is or not 
Going to put up a fight are you 
Come to headquarters 
Let me tell you something 
Policeman 
Arrest that man for assault 
Come here you Leave me alone 
Attacking a storm trooper 
You'll hear from my lawyer 
He bit my finger 
Sorry I didn't mean to hit you 
I enjoyed that 
But you'd better beat it 
I'll call a policeman No 
Why not 
Are you crazy 
More are coming 
More what 
Wait 
Come in here 
What's wrong with you 
Don't be foolhardy 
What's this 
Who hit you 
I think it was a gang 
What time is it 
All right they've gone 
Thanks mister That did me a lot of good 
You've sure got some nerve 
We should all fight back 
We didn't do so bad 
You're the barber who was in hospital 
Mr Jaeckel has talked about you 
We didn't think you'd come back 
The storm troopers will be after you 
Is this the man 
That's him 
Hail Hynkel 
Who's he 
Don't fool with me 
Hail Hynkel 
Your hands 
Just a moment 
Not here Bring him outside 
First you'll finish this Here 
Go on paint that 
Wait a minute boys I've got a bright idea 
Commander Schultz 
First in command 
Second in command 
Oh never mind 
You 
Who told you to hang people from lampposts 
What was the trouble 
A Jew attacking storm troopers 
Where is he 
There 
Break ranks 
So there you are 
Stand him up 
Get up 
You 
Don't you remember me 
You saved my life Me 
Strange 
And I always thought of you as an Aryan 
I'm a vegetarian 
Don't you remember 
We got away in my plane 
Plane 
Then we crashed 
Now I remember 
Well how are you 
What's my friend done 
He resisted my men painting his windows 
Any brave man would resist 
I'm sorry for this 
No harm 
In future you will not be molested again 
If you or your friends ever need help 
Who did that 
One of my friends 
Marshal Herring is waiting 
Enough 
I believe we've got something now 
Where 
I can spare one 
Professor Herr Kibitzen 
One hundred percent perfect 
Shoot 
Far from perfect 
Where's my secretary 
In the outer office 
Call her 
Take a letter 
I shall be up 
A parachute The most compact in the world 
Worn like a hat 
It will open in 25 feet 
Demonstrate professor 
Herring why do you waste my time like this 
Enough 
What's the meaning of this 
25 million for prison camps 
We need to manufacture munitions 
We've made a few arrests How many 
Five or ten thousand a day 
A day 
Just a few dissenters 
Dissenting about 
What more do they want 
It's from the finest lumber 
The people bah 
An assault on the ghetto 
Three months 
We must strike now 
We'll require foreign capital 
Borrow it 
The bankers have refused 
One man might make us a loan: 
Epstein 
Epstein 
He's a Jew isn't he 
Yes 
Then we'll change our policy 
At least till we've negotiated this loan 
You can't imagine what was going on 
If things get worse we can go to Osterlich 
That's still free 
Sooner or later we'll have to go 
Anyway it's nice to see you back 
It's like the old days again eh 
How's business 
Very slow 
The men are in concentration camp 
You should fix up the women 
The beauty parlour business 
Know anything about it 
You can learn You can practise on Hannah 
What for 
He's going to practise on you 
Not with mud on my face 
No we'll take some off 
Make me look beautiful 
Sure He can't make you look any worse 
Mrs Shoemaker's laundry 
I know I've seen you making eyes 
Don't pay any attention to him 
I like your shop since it's fixed up 
I've always lived up to every penny I've earned 
Why shouldn't I 
You're here today and gone tomorrow 
Do you believe in God 
I do 
I wouldn't 
Things are looking brighter now 
Maybe because of you saving Schultz 
Funny how they've left us alone 
Too good to be true 
Do you ever daydream 
I do 
That's the only time I'm really happy: 
Dreaming 
Aren't you like that 
We're very much alike 
Both absent minded You think so 
I like absent minded people 
My folks didn't think so 
You have an excuse You were injured in the war 
I was born that way 
I wonder why women never grow whiskers 
Isn't that foolish of me 
I could kick myself in the shins I could 
I'll give you a shampoo 
Ain't I cute 
How did you do it 
You should try it on yourself 
Fixed up you'd look handsome 
Four pecks a pound new potatoes 
The potato man 
I have to go 
Take it easy there 
Did you hurt yourself 
Careful next time Here's another one 
How do you do 
I don't want to go 
With all the persecution I still love it here 
Perhaps we don't have to go 
Full stop 
Nothing works Not even a sharp pencil 
I'll get you a pen 
Don't bother 
I won't send it 
Get out get out 
It will kill everybody 
All right 
Later 
A lady My secret agent 
Your secret agent 
Tell her to come here 
Any news from Epstein 
The leader 
Five of them 
Have them shot They were 
How many were going to strike 
Three thousand of them 
These men are skilled craftsmen 
Let's train others first then shoot them 
Cannot afford to be lenient 
The rhythm of production will be affected 
Rhythm All right have your rhythm 
But mark them for future reference 
That's my department I'll attend to that 
This way 
The strike leaders are all brunettes 
Not one blond 
Troublemakers Worse than Jews 
Then wipe them out Doucement 
How wonderful 
Why not a blond Europe Asia America 
And a brunette dictator Of the world 
Why not 
No nation would dare oppose you 
Dictator of the World 
It's your destiny 
Beautiful blond Aryans 
No you mustn't say it 
You make me afraid of myself 
Dictator of the World 
The nations will capitulate 
The world will be under your thumb 
Leave me 
I want to be alone 
Aut Caesar aut nullus 
Emperor of the World 
My world 
The happy hour programme 
Work with the rhythm of music 
Our next selection: 
Brahms' Hungarian Dance number five 
Fifteen cents please 
Happy hour signing off 
It seems like the old days again 
How long is it going to last 
Maybe 
What do you want 
Doesn't that make you feel good 
Get my Sunday shoes They're on the windowsill 
I can't find the shawl 
I've got a shawl 
What's going on 
They're dressing Hannah up to go out 
Is that so 
She's got a beau 
Who is it 
The barber 
Now turn around 
My dear 
Those hands What's the matter with them 
Those calluses 
They're so rough 
Maybe I better not go 
Don't be foolish He knows you do housework 
Wait 
I'll get a pair of mittens 
See if he's ready 
Not yet He's polishing a bald man's head 
Bad news 
What 
Epstein refuses to lend the money 
Epstein refuses eh 
Send for Schultz 
Epstein refuses 
What did he say 
First I shall deal with his people 
Your Excellency 
Call out the storm troopers 
A little mediaeval entertainment in the ghetto 
At such a time I think it ill advised 
Such demonstrations demoralise the country 
Indeed 
Since when do you care about the ghetto 
You need a holiday 
Fresh air 
A little outdoor exercise 
I'll send you to a concentration camp 
Place Schultz under arrest 
Very well but remember my words 
Traitor 
Traitor 
You're a double dyed democrat 
Schultz why have you forsaken me 
Excellency here are the notes for your speech 
I'll not need them 
Most amusing 
A fine photo on each 
We'd better go home Yeah 
Let's hurry 
Wait a minute 
What's that 
Turn off the radio 
The storm troopers 
Bar that door Get some water 
You men stay right here 
We've got to make a stand 
We might as well die as live like this 
Wait a minute 
These Jews attacked us 
I don't care 
Orders were to keep out 
You saw that 
I can't help it 
Schultz's orders 
Let's get going 
Orders or not I'm going to get that girl 
Out 
Schultz arrested 
Hear that 
He's arrested Commander Schultz 
Schultz is accused of treason and you know why 
Schultz was a friend of that barber 
Let's get the barber We want the barber 
It's the storm troopers 
Get on the roof No 
They'll kill you I'll fight 
All right here we are Smash in the door 
Come on we'll give the barber a haircut 
Where are the bombs 
There goes the barbershop 
Never mind 
We can start again 
Mr Jaeckel says it's beautiful 
His brother's got a vineyard 
Mr Jaeckel said he'd take me with him 
Now we can all go together 
There's money to be made in chickens 
Look at that star 
Isn't it beautiful 
All right the coast is clear 
All right I'll be down 
What does this Schultz want of us 
He wants us to blow up the palace What 
I know it but Schultz has them all hypnotised 
In order to carry this out one of us must die 
At a feast by lottery the victim was chosen 
Each man will receive a pudding 
Concealed in one of these is a coin 
Why 
Don't you understand 
He's too well known 
It must be somebody like us 
I can't see it like that 
Commander Schultz I apologise for my friend 
Very well then 
Until then 
Hail Hynk 
What am I saying 
Gentlemen we have pledged our honour 
Proceed 
Gentlemen the coin is here 
What's the meaning of this 
Somebody made a fool of us 
I did What 
I put a coin in every pudding 
Blowing up palaces and wanting to kill people 
We're in enough trouble 
Hannah's right We've all been foolish 
The papers say Schultz may be in the ghetto 
Here read it for yourself 
Hannah read that 
Me 
Only for questioning Not too serious 
Who is it 
It's me Mr Mann 
I know I know 
Don't you realise there are spies everywhere 
Spies 
What's the matter 
He's wanted for questioning 
Where's the Commander 
In the next room

To the invasion of Osterlich 
Elephant 
Wait 
Napaloni's army is on the Osterlich front 
60 000 men are on the border 
I can't believe it 
You can't believe it 
You let him steal a march on us 
I had the ground covered 
Declare war on Napaloni 
Attack Bacteria at once 
But Do as I tell you 
Madness Shut up 
Will you sign this 
What is it 
A declaration of war 
Yes 
A pen 
I'll sign it 
A pen 
I'll sign it 
It's Napaloni Wait a minute 
You talk to him 
What'll I say 
Be nice affable pleasant 
Well well how are you 
No he hasn't been playing much 
You went round in 92 
His Excellency 
Just now he's a little hoarse 
No I mean he can't talk 
May I take a message 
He wants to discuss it 
Ask him to come here 
Very well I'll make the arrangements 
He's coming 
Good 
And this 
What is it 
Your declaration of war 
Peace is declared 
How do you do 
See about the photography 
Not the back of his head Yes sir 
Napaloni's train is coming into the station 
From a pink and white carriage 
What's all this mix up a 
They've gone too far 
At ease 
Bring the carpet 
Why can't a we get out here 
No a carpet 
Who cares 
Me Napaloni I never get out without a carpet 
Lay it down here 
Quick 
It's going back What 
Let's get out while it's stopping 
Shut up 
Take it away 
Stay here until they've made up their minds 
You got a da carpet 
Put it down 
Here he is 
My friend Napaloni 
This is indeed a pleasure Welcome to Tomainia 
This way 
Pictures 
Sure 
Salute 
Another please 
You want another 
There 
Where's a my ambassador 
Hello Spook 
How do you feel 
Look after mamma 
Hynky did you meet a my wife 
That's her 
Let's go 
Your clock is a slow 
This way 
It's a very nice people 
The people are very nice 
Thank you 
He's my husband 
You make a mistake You make a big a mistake 
To make him feel your superiority 
We must put him in his place 
But how 
By means of psychology 
By making him feel inferior 
This can be done subtly 
For instance 
His position will be inferior 
Where is he now 
Resting 
Another psychological triumph 
Signor Napaloni is now leaving his room 
He's coming Quick give me a flower 
At all times be above him before him 
Entering or leaving you must be first 
Hello Hynky 
How are you feel 
My brother dictate 
This is a lovely place 
I feel a fine 
Won't you sit down 
Well Hynky my dictator friend you 
I must be a growing 
What do they give me 
A baby stool 
This is not for me I like it better upstairs 
I thought the public enthusiastic 
Sure 
They like to see new faces 
What's that 
Madam Napaloni at the station 
Match 
I'm sorry 
Don't apologise 
I find a one 
I'm simply crazy about this palace 
Ivory and gold A lovely combination 
Gets away from that gingerbread idea 
The grand ball this evening 
And a review of the army 
That won't take a long 
I'm afraid it will 
So you got a big army huh 
Modesty forbids 
Seems I've heard about it 
I think I'll get me a shave 
We have a barbershop 
Is that so 
Delighted Good 
Very well this way 
This is it I can a smell 'em 
This is a very sweet 
It was the library 
A good barbershop 
Too old fashioned Is that so 
When I get shaved I like something to look at 
So I'm putting in glass walls 
This way I shall have a view of the mountains 
And this a view through the glass ceiling 
What's above 
The ballroom 
In my summer palace I have a barbershop 
Is that so 
Also with glass walls 
You don't tell me 
With goldfish inside 
Goldfish swimming inside the walls 
How do you feed them 
Very interesting You like it 
The Hynkel stadium 
What 
Nothing 
I'm just chewing 
Some peanuts 
I've had some Good shape 
Here you are Spook 
Now passing Tomainia's heavy artillery 
It's all right 
Where from 
Aroma 
Aroma 
That's 400 miles away 
Right I don't know what's detaining them 
Now passing Tomainia's light artillery 
Very light 
Where's the propellers 
For going under the water 
Under water 
What's that 
Under the water and in the air 
Obsolete now 
We're concentrating on flying dreadnoughts 
What's that 
My planes 
Now passing Hynkel's flying division number 34 
Our planes 
You're right 
They're yours 
To disarm suspicion you will go hunting 
Herring and I will be waiting at the capital 
First Napaloni must remove his troops 
To be decided tonight 
Where is Napaloni 
I'll look for him 
It'll carry weight 
You mean I will 
You find him And let me know at once 
Madam Napaloni Your Excellency 
Because I no speak 
No 
May I have the pleasure 
Allow me 
Madam your dancing was superb 
Excellent 
Very good 
Good 
My dear Adenoid Benzino 
I've been looking for you 
As you wish An excellent idea 
To the buffet 
Of course this way 
There's a Tomainian proverb 
Funny 
I wish I understand it 
Now about the border 
Yes 
No problem 
It should be no trouble 
What's the matter 
Wait 
You too 
Out 
Out 
So the border question 
It's just a matter of detail Formalities 
Strawberries 
Have you any English mustard 
English mustard 
That's da hot a stuff 
Very hot 
Good shape 
Cream 
Hynky I'm going to make this very simple 
When your troops are gone I sign 
That's a right 
Just a minute you don't understand 
First we sign then I remove a da troops 
Precisely 
I sign after Just a minute 
Hey Spook treaty 
Hold a dis 
Now look you sign a dis treaty first 
Then I remove my troops after 
Why are we arguing 
You said I remove first 
I can't sign while they're there 
I won't remove them till you sign Why not 
Why should I 
Osterlich is a free country 
Your soldiers are there 
And they'll stay until you sign 
I'll blow them off 
This won't get us anywhere 
To quote an old Latin phrase 
Strawberries 
Where's a my sandwich 
Another one 
I don't get this treatment in my own joint 
Can't we discuss this without passion 
I'm not a passionate 
I'm just 
I want him to sign the treaty 
I won't move until you sign 
Not until you clear the border will I sign 
Then they remain 
Then I kick them off 
You want a start a world war 
You and the world I'll throw in the ocean 
Strawberries 
Your Excellency we have 
What's the matter 
What ails you 
This isn't like you 
Hey Garbitsch come here 
Mustard on his strawberries 
My little bambino 
The Bacterian 
You cannot treat Bacteria this way 
He's a tearing spaghetti 
He sign a the treaty or we have a war 
Give me a something Quick give me a something 
I have an appointment What's this 
Press How's the conference progressing 
Very successfully How did you get in 
How did he get here 
You know the regulations about reporters 
There are minor details to be cleaned up 
Excuse me we're busy 
The whole world will know we're fighting 
So what 
Can't we come to an agreement 
When he signs 
I sign nothing 
I must speak to you alone Do you mind 
Mind 
I don't mind 
Sign 
Sign 
He'll have the advantage 
It's a mere scrap of paper 
I'll sign 
What 
Hold a this 
Ah my little Hynky My dictator brother 
I knew we have a no trouble 
Two prisoners escaped in officers' uniforms 
Sound the alarm Two prisoners escaped 
The planes are searching for us 
The woods 
No the open The border's that way 
The invasion of Osterlich 
Now or never 
Ducks 
Did you hear that 
It came from over there 
What 
Don't answer back 
Where's Schultz 
You won't talk eh 
He will when we get him to camp Come on 
If we can pass through there we're safe 
Through the woods 
If you see anyone don't look right or left 
We must bluff our way through 
Here they come 
Can you see what they're doing 
Looking this way Keep going 
They're following us 
Shall we run 
Certainly not 
Just a little bit 
Keep walking 
We could walk faster 
Make up your mind 
Slow down 
No There's no hurry 
He's here 
Sound assembly 
Attention 
Present arms 
Turn back 
No keep going 
Hail Hynkel 
Your Excellency everything is under control 
Good Good 
Good Good 
Are we ready to start 
Yes Yes 
Gentlemen 
Schultz I'm happy you're with us again 
Thank you 
Where are we going 
You're invading Osterlich 
They're coming 
Your Excellency 
The world awaits your words 
What's happened 
He looks strange 
What's Schultz doing here 
Pardoned I suppose 
His Excellency Herr Garbitsch 
Victory shall come to the worthy 
No nation can progress with such ideas 
Let him who refuses beware 
You must speak 
I can't 
You must 
It's our only hope 
Hope 
I'm sorry but I don't want to be an emperor 
That's not my business 
I don't want to rule or conquer anyone 
I should like to help everyone: 
Jew gentile black man white 
We don't want to hate one another 
Machinery has left us in want 
We think too much and feel too little 
More than machinery we need humanity 
The aeroplane and radio have brought us closer 
To those who can hear me I say do not despair 
So long as men die liberty will never perish 
You have the love of humanity in you 
In the name of democracy let us use that power 
Promising these things brutes have risen 
But they lie 
Now let us fight to fulfil that promise 
Hannah can you hear me 
Wherever you are look up Hannah 
Look up Hannah 
The soul of man has been given wings 
Look up Hannah 
Look up 
Did you hear that 
That's Mr Hammond 
Come inside 
Yes missy 
Send someone for him 
Yes missy 
And get word to Mr Crosbie 
Yes missy 
What are you doing here all of you 
Go away Go away I tell you 
Mr Withers 
Mr Withers

What's the matter 
Mr Crosbie Mr Hammond has been shot 
What What's that you said 
Mr Hammond is dead Missy say hurry 
Mr Howard Joyce 
Yes the lawyer 
Right And hurry 
Where's my wife 
She locked herself in 
She wouldn't see me until you came 
Mr Withers I'm Howard Joyce 
How do you do 
Let me in 
Leslie darling it's Robert 
What's happened 
Leslie what's happened 
Didn't they tell you 
They said Hammond was killed 
is he still there 
I had your head boy remove the body to a shed 
He tried to make love to me and I shot him 
Leslie 
Oh Robert I'm so glad you've come 
There darling 
Hold me tight I'm so frightened 
Leslie darling it'll be all right 
Howard how nice of you to come 
Naturally I'd want to be here if I can help 
Then you will help us 
Of course I will ln every way I can 
You're a dear Darling 
How's Dorothy 
She's very well and anxious to see you 
Has her niece arrived from England 
Here you better be resting 
I do feel dreadfully faint 
I'm sorry to be so tiresome 
Was Hammond dead Oh yes 
He was just riddled with bullets 
What 
Here's the revolver 
All six chambers are empty 
Here you two Better have a drink yourselves 
Thanks but I'm afraid I shouldn't 
I'll have one Bob 
I'm on duty of a sort you know 
Feeling any better 
Much better thank you 
l'll try Take your time Mrs Crosbie 
Remember we're all friends here 
You've been so patient 
I never mind being alone 
Probably didn't want anyone to hear him 
Geoff Hammond 
Of course l said 
Come in and have a drink 
Were you surprised to see him 
Well I was rather 
We hadn't seen him for ages had we 
Three months at least 
Yes darling 
What happened 
He said l'm so sorry 
Well we went on chatting 
What 
lt's hardly worth repeating 
He paid me a little compliment 
He said You have very pretty eyes 
Had he ever said anything of the sort before 
Did you answer him 
l said: 
l don't understand 
Let her finish 
Well that rather put my back up 
Robert you silly thing 
Oh no He tried to take one of my hands 
Don't be an idiot l said 
I didn't want to make a fuss 
The next thing he said to me 
He looked at me straight in the face and said: 
Don't you know I'm awfully in love with you 
Swine 
Were you surprised 
But of course I was surprised 
Go on Leslie 
I began to wonder if he'd been drinking before 
Never occurred to me I couldn't manage him 
I wish there were some way we could spare you 
All you can remember of them 
Very well I'll tell you the rest 
I got up from that chair there 
And I stood in front of the table here 
I held out my hand 
Good night l said 
But he didn't move 
l'm not going he said 
Then I began to lose my temper 
Robert's away he said 
Well that was the last straw 
lf you don't leave immediately l said 
He took hold of my arm and swung me back 
I struggled to tear myself away from him 
Can't go on 
Somehow he stumbled on those steps 
We fell and I got away from him 
I seized the gun as he came toward me 
Then I followed him out to the veranda 
It was only then I knew what I'd done 
My poor darling 
How did the revolver happen to be there 
When I leave Leslie alone 
You're all very kind 
If you'll come with me I'd like to look around 
Yes of course 
Be back in a few minutes 
My poor child 
Robert what have I done 
It's so horrible to think that I killed him 
What shall we call this 
Late supper or early breakfast 
I don't care what we call it I'm famished 
Thank you l can't vouch for it 
I can and will 
But out here one gets so lazy 
The boys take such good care of us 
Funny the head boy running off tonight 
Yes it is odd 
Excellent Leslie Thank you gentlemen 
Right away 
I think that's the first thing to do don't you 
Yes I think that's the best thing to do 
Would I have to be arrested 
You see as a matter of fact 
You're by way of being under arrest now 
It's purely a matter of form 
Shall I be imprisoned 
Well that depends on the attorney general 
He's a decent fellow 
I'm sure he'll do everything he can 
What do you mean be able to accept bail 
Well my dear it depends on what the charge is 
What do you mean by that 
What charge 
Murder 
Oh Robert Robert 
It's all right 
Nobody's going to do anything to you 
Nothing's going to happen 
We have been happy haven't we 
You've been the best wife a man could have 
If only there was something I could do 
You can love me That's all I need 
I've always loved you 
Yes but now 
All right darling I'll get ready 
I say what a swine that man was 
Did you know Hammond 
l knew him a little Was he a heavy drinker 
I don't know that he was 
Generous with his money 
Did you like him 
That's true 
Well they ought to be ready pretty soon 
By George that's beautiful 
I wager she's faster than you at that 
is there room for me or shall I follow 
Come with us There's plenty of room 
Oh Leslie 
Yes 
There's one question I'd like to ask 
Yes what is it 
When I was looking at Hammond's body 
Yes Howard what is it 
afterhewaslyingontheground 
I know it must sound terribly cold blooded 
butI wasso terrified 
Put it out of your mind 
Will you please come in 
Thank you 
Have a chair old man 
Not at the moment Ong Thanks 
Ong's been of great help on the case 
Finds out everything 
Perfect confidential clerk 
Trouble is after he's left my business 
he'llsetup hisown office in opposition 
How is everything 
Everything's fine 
It's funny that you've taken it so much harder 
Leslie hasn't turned a hair 
But your plantation What about that 
I hate the house and every tree on the place 
Why don't you come and stay in town with us 
Dorothy's for it and so am I 
Thanks I think I will 
I won't be so lonely 
It'll make me feel better just to be that near 
I haven't closed my eyes the last three nights 
You don't want her to have to cheer you up 
She's a plucky girl 
It's a farce 
Why make her go through the ordeal of a trial 
She shot him as she would have shot a mad dog 
You don't have to convince me Bob 
I know I'm sorry 
Will she be one of the witnesses 
l shan't call her 
Well I know you're busy Howard 
So long Bob 
Bring your things across soon as you can Right 
Come in 
Yes 
lf you are not too busy sir 
No trouble at all Ong 
Well what matter is it 
Yes 
A circumstance has come to my attention sir 
That's not surprising 
During the course of seven years 
Well 
forseveralweeks 
Yes 
wasnotin everyrespectaccurate 
Have you seen the letter 
I have with me a copy sir 
The original is in possession of a woman 
That's more than I have It's inconceivable 
Yes sir 
Thank you sir Mr Joyce 
Yes 
Yes that's right 
Stay in the visiting room as long as you want 
Howard how good of you to come 
Morning Leslie l wasn't expecting you 
How are you today Mrs Cooper 
Fine lt's a different place 
It's a shame she has to stay here at all 
Thank you 
Oh how lovely I do miss my garden 
You're looking very well Leslie 
Well this is a wonderful place to rest 
Well it's only five days more 
It's Robert I'm worried about 
He's taking it terribly hard 
Poor darling 
Well Howard I must confess to you 
I'mnotlookingforwardtotestifying in court 
And what does that suggest to your legal mind 
Or 
I'm afraid I have a very poor memory 
Don't suppose I said more than two words to him 
And you hadn't written to him 
Oh no 
A lot of calls upon his time and 
You're quite certain that was all 
Well I may as well tell you 
We heard about his wife 
And once quite by chance I actually saw her 
Oh You never mentioned that 
What was she like 
Horrible 
havinganythingto do withHammond 
Yes 
Better read it for yourself 
But that's not my handwriting l know 
What does it mean 
That's for you to say Leslie 
l didn't write it I swear I didn't 
Well 
Howard wait 
Wait a minute 
I thought none of you would believe me 
ifI admittedthathe'dcome at my invitation 
whenRobertwasaway 
Well I'll tell you why Howard 
I was planning a surprise for Robert's birthday 
I'd heard he wanted a new gun and 
Perhaps you've forgotten what's in the letter 
Will you read it again 
No I don't want to 
Robert will be away for the night 
I absolutely must see you 
Don't drive up Leslie 
I didn't say that just to cheer him up 
It'll put the prosecution on the track of 
suspicionswhichhave entered nobody's mind 
It's the duty of counsel to defend his client 
Mrs Cooper 
Good heavens What's happened 
I'm quite all right Really I am 
Thank you 
Make her lie quiet Mr Joyce 
I'm afraid I've made rather a mess of things 
I'm sorry 
For Robert not for me 
You've distrusted me from the beginning 
That's neither here nor there Leslie 
Who's got the letter 
Hammond's wife 
Are you going to let them hang me 
What do you mean by that Leslie 
You could get the letter 
Surely nothing would have been said to you 
iftheownerweren'tquiteprepared to sell it 
That's true 
You mean you could save me and won't 
What harm have I done you 
How could you be so cruel 
Cruel 
You must be insane Leslie 
A lawyer has a duty to his profession 
tohimself 
No 
I can't do what you ask 
Poor Robert He doesn't deserve it 
He's never hurt anyone in his life 
I mean everything 
everythingintheworldtohim 
This will ruin his life 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't despise you 
I'm going to do what I can 
Bob will want to know what the money's for 
Will it be a very large sum 
You won't have to show Bob the letter will you 
He'll be an important witness 
And after the trial 
I'm going to try and save your life 
What are you doing here Ong 
What about 
The letter sir 
Oh yes 
It's obviously a forgery 
In that case there would be no objection 
No none at all 
But Mr Joyce 
What value did he put on it 
Ten thousand dollars 
Only 1 0 000 
Why not 50 or 1 00 
For the reason sir 
Tell your friend to go to the devil 
But Mr Joyce 
The woman does not want to sell the letter 
My friend took a long time to persuade her 
Ten thousand dollars is a lot of money Ong 
Yes sir 
It is a great deal of money 
I'll speak to Mr Crosbie 
He's waiting for you at the club sir What 
All right Have the woman come to my office 
I was about to mention sir 
And the other condition 
You must be mad 
Ong Chi Seng 
Yes sir 
What are you getting out of this 
Two thousand dollars 
Howard 
You're looking more cheerful Bob 
Gentlemen Two gin slings Jerry 
Yes sir 
Nothing important 
Well what is it 
Your birthday was about then wasn't it 
Yes that's right End of April 
This was a pretty serious mistake 
andsherealizedit 
Who has the letter 
Hammond's widow 
Well what if she does 
Well yes 
What's to be done about it 
Well 
I want you to authorize me to buy it 
Well I'll do whatever you think is right 
I don't think it's right 
l'll pay back whatever it costs Good 
Now put the matter out of your mind 
Mix me another one Jerry 
Another sir 
Yes another 
Yes sir 
Residence 
Oh do stop fussing 
What's it going to be 
It's lovely 
Does anyone feel like bridge 
Or what would be nice 
Leslie what would you like to do 
I'm putting her in the witness box tomorrow 
Bob why don't you take the girls to a picture 
Will it take all evening 
There's a lot to go over 
Yes darling why don't you 
Take your mind off tomorrow I want you to 
All right then 
Well I guess we'd better be off 
Shall we want wraps 
You're likely to coming home 
See you later darling Goodbye darling 
Goodbye Have a good time 
Where do we have to go 
Chinese Quarter 
Ong Chi Seng will take us 
He'll be along soon 
Of course I'd have chosen other circumstances 
Oh I'm sorry Howard 
I didn't mean to be flippant 
Really I didn't 
Well whatever else I am 
I'mnotungrateful 
Forget what I said 
A few years ago 
How did you happen to take it up 
I had nothing else to do 
It appealed to me 
It must take enormous concentration 
andpatience 
I find it soothing 
You mean it takes your mind off other things 
is that a legal question 
You're not an ordinary client Leslie 
No that isn't it 
You've been 
What 
Trying to read my thoughts 
I'm trying to understand you 
Why 
Because I'm so 
soevil 
That's it isn't it 
Time we were starting 
I think we had better not drive up sir 
All right Ong 
Will you follow me please 
Please wait here for a minute

The jury is aware of the facts 
And I'm convinced there's no need for eloquence 
Mrs Crosbie killed a man yes 
butundercircumstances where no courageous

Yes recess 
Jury's been out for exactly 25 minutes 
They've no right to do anything but 
Darling you're not making things easier 
Oh Leslie I'm sorry 
The court is reassembling sir 
Bring in the jury 
Prisoner of the bar rise and face the jury 
Gentlemen have you reached your verdict 
We have 
Not guilty 
Leslie darling Robert darling 
Howard splendid case 
Permit me to congratulate you sir 
Just one moment please 
Hold it just a second please Again 
Thank you 
Thank you 
Thank you very much 
Come darling 
Leslie's safe 
What's the matter darling 
Feeling neglected 
Here's a cocktail 
lt was an excellent speech Thank you 
You half wits I know she's innocent 
Well 
I shan't be a minute 
No I want your legal opinion 
Darling 
Oh 
What's up 
We've got to get away for good How could we 
Can't very well throw up your job 
But I have something in view that's much better 
Come on Sit down 
Something has just come up In Sumatra 
We'd start a new life 
I wouldn't mind that I'm used to being alone 
I'll go ahead and we can fix things up at once 
ls the money as good as here 
l hope it'll be better 
What do you mean 
Why sweat out my life for others 
How on earth are you going to raise $30 000 
Well I've saved about 1 0 
I'll be perfectly all right here 
Really 
Nonsense Just now you said you wanted to go 
But we're making a mistake in running away 
The thing to do is to stick it out here 
I tell you it's a thoroughly sound proposition 
And in 1 0 years I can make enough to retire 
But I really want to stay here 
Anyhow it's not a thing to rush into 
Robert please l have photos of the bungalow 
l don't want to see them Come now 
That's just nerves 
Shows how necessary it is for you to get away 
I won't be a minute 
What are you going to do 
What can I do 
Don't tell him I can't bear any more 
He can't He hasn't got it Give me time 
Where's the letter 
I have it in my pocket 
It would break his heart 
What shall I do 
I wish to heaven I knew 
If only there were some other way 
Tell him and have done with it 
Now this is really a handsome estate 
We'll be practically stealing it for 30 000 
You'll be keen on the house 
I mean hasn't it struck you that the costs 
Oh you mean the legal expenses yes 
But there are other expenses 
What do these other expenses amount to 
Yes I'd almost forgotten about that 
You were going to 
l had to pay a great deal of money for it 
How much was it 
Ten thousand dollars 
Ten thousand dollars 
You must have been mad 
But that's every cent i have in the world 
I didn't dare 
If you wanted Leslie acquitted 
But what was there in the letter 
You asked him to come to the bungalow 
Yes You wanted to get me something 
You know how ignorant I am 
Yes it was 
Then why did you do it 
You of all people 
What were you trying to save me from 
Why make me a present of another 
How should I know you were buying a gun 
l told you l'd forgotten 
What do you mean Robert 
Why are you talking to me like this 
Who has the letter now 
Have you got it 
Yes Where is it 
It's not your letter or mine Bob 
Let him see it 
What does it mean 
No no Wait 
What does it mean 
It means that I was in love with Geoff Hammond 
No We'd been in love for years 
Every time I met him I hated myself 
It was horrible 
Even my agony was a kind of joy 
Then I heard about that 
That native woman 
I couldn't believe it I wouldn't believe it 
At last I saw her 
thatchalkypaintedface 
But I couldn't give him up 
I sent for him You read the letter 
I hadn't seen him for 1 0 days 
He denied it I was frantic 
I don't know what I said to him 
I hated him because he made me despise myself 
I insulted him I cursed him 
I was beside myself 
At last he turned on me 
thatshewasthe onlyone that meant anything 
Heard a cry and I knew I'd hit him 
He staggered toward the veranda 
There's no excuse for me 
I don't deserve to live 
I'm sorry 
He's going to forgive you 
Yes 
He's going to forgive me 
Leslie 
Leslie 
Yes Come in 
They're waiting l'm sorry Dorothy 
It took me rather a long time to dress 
It's a lovely dress

Ten pesos if you please 
Well done señor 
And all I did was sit on his back 
You go to an affair of the court señor 
No of the heart 
Something is wrong 
The face man The face 
Why the fine feathers 
Santa María It slipped my mind 
Why do I have to meet every swordsman in Madrid 
But tell him I'll meet him tomorrow 
Señores your attention please 
I'm buying wine for all 
Last chance 
What do you mean 
I sail on the first ship from Lisbon 
To California 
But what about your commission here 
I'll have to give that up 
What's California like 
Are the Indians troublesome 
No 
Then who is there to fight 
No one 
This 
Leave it there 
Wine 
A toast señores 
How are the vineyards Bearing well 
By some miracle the grapes remain sweet 
Why so gloomy 
Hatred for whom 
The alcalde may his soul burn in hell 
The alcalde 
A kinder better man never lived 
You don't know him señor 
I should know him He's my father 
Well I said it and I won't deny it 
Row row Get me to shore 
Buenos días señor 
Buenos días 
I'm honoured How can I serve you 
A glass of your best wine 
You are a stranger in these parts señor 
No not exactly 
I was born and raised not far from here 
I am the son of the alcalde 
Wake up Didn't you hear me 
Sí señor 
This way señor 
He is the son of His Excellency the alcalde 
I want to be driven to Los Angeles 
I'll pay you well 
What's come over this country 
Have you all gone mad 
My father 
What are you talking about 
I'm sorry 
Huh 
Your name 
He claims to be the son of the alcalde 
I'm honoured Capitán but bewildered 
We take care of the government 
I see 
I see Tell me who holds the office now 
Don Luis Quintero I'll take you to him 
I'd like to see my family Where are they 
At your old hacienda 
Sí mi capitán 
Foolish habit of mine 
Do you fancy the weapon 
I know very little about it my dear capitán 
So this bird killed the black breasted red 
Yes Your Excellency 
Was it a bloody battle 
Pity I missed it What are you asking for him 
Oh this is a noble bird Well tested 
I'm asking 40 pesos for him Excellency 
Not one centimo will he cost you 
Señor 
And what caballero is this 
Or is he some young lord from Spain 
A good guess Excellency He's just from Spain 
Of course to be sure 
I thank Your Excellency 
Luis Luis 
I need 
Money money money It's always money 
He's off your precious ship from Spain 
How delightful 
Will one of you ill mannered boors present him 
Don Diego Vega Señora Inez de Quintero 
My wife señor 
Señora 
Your Excellency is a very fortunate man 
We're overwhelmed by the latest fashions 
Patience my love You'll see it all someday 
Doubtless when I'm an old hag 
Did you hear 
How easily he makes pretty speeches 
You were saying Don Diego 
Oh yes 
Don't leave me to these barbarians 
As for ornaments and jewels 
But Don Diego must see his parents 
Too true Duty rather than pleasure 
Excellency Capitán 
Señora 
I'll see you to the door 
You think not 
It's possible 
Who was that 
Oh no one you know 
Someone new Very charming 
He must be from the colour in your cheeks 
When can I meet him 
Listen to the child 
It makes her look like a woman grown 
I am a woman grown I'll be 18 my next birthday 
Carmen Castellano is younger and already wed 
Carmen Castellano Her grandmother was a peon 
Such riffraff wed when they like 
See She didn't flick an ear 
Only when they are stubborn 
Turn right in here driver 
Adiós 
Oh Mother 
Diego 
My son My baby 
Mother 
Hello María 
I'm so happy to see you 
Good old Juan fat as ever 
Hello Manuel And José Where's Father 
Take Don Diego's things to his room 
Sí señora 
I tell you these conditions are beyond bearing 
Nothing 
What can Diego 
Father 
Diego 
My boy 
Padre 
Welcome back to your home and my heart Diego 
Oh Padre I've missed your wise counsel 
Not too greatly I suspect 
You remember Don Miguel and Don José 
Señores 
Have you returned to steal more melons 
Melons 
I feel good muscle here 
Arms muscle You men 
Madre de Dios is he without a face 
I looked like a frightened gopher 
More like a young angel I'm sure 
An angel that's what we need in California now 
An angel with a flaming sword 
Please don't start that 
He didn't come home to get himself killed 
Hold your tongue Go to your women 
Leave my son to me Sit down Diego 
What is all this Father 
In my place is a man 
In his place sits a viper so foul and black 
God forgive me 
Why did you resign in the first place 
I was forced out of office 
They threatened to burn the homes of the peons 
And now he sits here doing nothing when 
Enough Felipe Enough 
Even if I thought it would succeed I'd refuse 
But why Father 
Because the law is the law my son 
But that government is now vile and corrupt 
That is my feeling also 
Sometimes one must fight fire with fire 
Nor will my son No 
No no of course not Father 
Pleasant scorpions Agreeable rattlesnakes 
It's all the rage just now Watch closely 
Bah 
Stay where you are 
Put this up 
Put it up Be quick about it 
Back to the barracks 
Zorro 
Zorro 
And without an escort 
I have my reasons 
Suppose you share them with me 
Look Gold 
This goes to Spain For us my love for us 
Of course he would have claimed his share 
I'm afraid so 
Don't move if you want to live 
A bandit 
I have distressing news for Your Excellency 
I will act for him Hand it over 
And now that little trinket 
You would rob a woman 
I can't afford gallantries 
I refuse 
Adiós 
Zorro 
What a nice quiet study Your Excellency 
I like a quiet room Very quiet 
What do you want 
Why why do you ask 
Which will it be 
Spain 
It's a very wise choice 
He's had experience 
What does it matter to me 
As you wish 
Close your eyes 
What are you going to do 
What what's that 
Don't move until I take it away 
What if I faint 
You won't 
What's this 
Are you trying to commit suicide 
Speak up What's the matter 
Esteban Esteban 
Esteban he was here 
Who was here Zo 
Zorro 
Ridiculous 
Your fears have addled your brain 
I tell you he was here in this very room 
Hey Anybody pass by this way 
No one mi capitán 
Has anyone entered this room 
His Excellency and yourself 
Anyone else 
No mi capitán 
Do you need any more proof 
You must have fallen asleep and dreamed it 
Did I dream that 
Sergeant Capitán 
Turn out the guard 
Zorro is somewhere on the grounds Find him 
Sí mi capitán 
I still can't believe the fellow was here 
How did he get in 
I'd like to know that 
It's your business to find out 
What did he say 
He wants me in Spain and Vega in my place 
Vega 
A brigand wouldn't concern himself with Vega 
It would serve you right if I did go to Spain 
And give up 50 000 pesos a year 
But what protection 
You can't keep even one mad dog off my neck 
Can't I 
I'll find him I promise you 
I can't afford to lose you my dear Luis 
No you can't Your pickings end 
if anything happens to me 
That's exactly what I meant Excellency 
Someone I can love and respect 
Let him be kind and brave 
And handsome please dear Mother 
Is that a sin 
The sin would be in sending you to one 
I don't understand 
Well a young girl with your 
You mean in serving God 
Yes yes of course In a way 
In what way 
Do you follow me 
Well I I think so 
You mean that I might marry and 
Yes yes exactly 
I was praying just now for a husband 
You were Fine 
From what 
I'm troubled deeply 
Girls of my own age No one ever comes here 
Why 
They they hate my Uncle Luis 
Decidedly wrong What do you think 
No no don't be glad about that 
but I'm convinced 
Oh Inez Oh no 
No that's not why she's sending me No 
No 
María says she's jealous 
She says it's because I'm well good looking 
María has excellent eyesight 
Thank you Father but are you sure 
No one except María ever says I'm pretty 
Pretty 
You you really think that 
With all my heart 
Oh I've never heard such words before 
They make me almost lose my breath 
You're not in the least like Fray Ramón 
You talk so strangely 
They think he's hiding close by 
The beast may try to rob the altar 
Good night Padre 
Oh Padre you dropped something 
There he is 
There There 
Ernesto Romero 
Sí señor 
Three pesos 
Tres pesos

Manuel Villa 
Sí señor 
Four pesos 
Four pesos 
Sí señor 
Sebastián Moreno

Nine pesos 
But señor we will starve 
How can I feed my family 
Nine pesos 
Señor please I beg of you My little girl 
No no no no no 
That's all 
I'll relieve you of that Sergeant 
I'll take that 
Get back 
After him 
Hear our prayer 
Lord hear our prayer 
And drive far away from it 
And drive far away from it 
all the snares of the enemy 
all the snares of the enemy 
And let thy holy angels dwell therein 
And let thy holy angels dwell therein 
to keep us at peace to keep us at peace 
And may thy blessings 
And may thy blessings 
be upon us always 
be upon us always 
Amen 
Amen 
Benedictio Dei omnipotentis 
Amen 
Viva María 
Muera el pecado 
Good evening Padre 
Diego 
What's the meaning of this 
How dare you 
We are after Zorro He rode towards the mission 
Good evening Sergeant 
Good evening señor 
Zorro you say What's he done now 
Enough to get himself hanged 
Have you seen him 
I have only this moment left the chapel 
How long have you been here señor 
Some little time It seems like hours 
It's a dull game but what can one do 
You have seen or heard nothing Of Zorro 
Oh heaven spare me 
My blood chills at the thought 
Out of here Search the grounds 
What's disturbing you Padre 
Thoughts of that bandit 
Puppy 
Oh my dear Padre really 
Can't you even listen to what I'm saying 
Thank you Mother 
Quick hide this plunder 
Plunder 
What is this 
It's some of the alcalde's gold 
You took it 
Have you seen this one Padre 
Zorro 
No Padre the dispenser 
My boy 
My boy 
My Diego 
Padre 
I see 
I see everything 
Diego don't deceive your father any longer 
It's not fair to him 
I don't like doing it Padre believe me 
But I must 
Amusing don't you think 
If you live 
Thank you 
Oh what's this What's this 
Don Diego Vega 
Oh yes Don Diego 
Well what can I do for you 
Oh did I 
Excellent excellent 
Come into my study till my wife appears 
Tell me why is this house so closely guarded 
I swear I saw a full company around it 
I wish there were twice as many 
Their clatter would drive me to distraction 
I find it reassuring 
Let me show you something young man 
Look 
Madre de Dios The mark of Zorro 
He came here one night 
He threatened my life and left that 
I should be petrified 
He's mad of course Quite mad 
You think so 
Of course 
There was a case in Madrid almost identical 
This fellow's mark was a cross He was a madman 
Cunning beyond belief They always are 
He killed 40 people 
Slit their throats from ear to ear 
Warned them first you know and then 
Santa María 
Frightful risk 
Sense of duty 
Oh yes Yes of course 
I'd promised the morning to him it seems 
I was positively suffocating with boredom 
Then let's fly I'm dying for a canter 
Oh goodbye Luis Don't work too hard 
Goodbye Excellency Goodbye goodbye 
I have a plan 
Yes 
What is it 
Well go on 
Perhaps but how can we prove it 
We can at least help the situation How 
Form an alliance with Don Alejandro 
That's impossible You know Vega's attitude 
Perfectly but Lolita should have a husband 
Diego and Lolita 
Not bad 
Not bad at all 
Oh it's a pity 
What Diego 
Of what were you thinking 
I know 
May I tell you something Diego Anything 
Yes of course I may 
I felt from the moment we met that we 
Oh but my dear no 
But I'm dying here 
Go to Spain but not with Esteban 
With whom then Diego 
With your husband 
My husband 
Go to romantic beautiful Spain with Luis 
Well let me explain 
you'd be completely ostracised 
Oh I see 
But Luis at court imagine 
But I'd be lost among so many Not you 
But I have no such friend in Madrid 
Oh Diego 
What you suggest is utterly impossible 
25 000 
Are you buying my son Señor Quintero 
In that case my friendly attitude will cease 
What is all this fatiguing turmoil about 
His niece 
How flattering 
industrious than under his regime 
Grinding them into poverty 
to line your own pockets is hardly 
Oh politics politics 
What have they to do with my marriage 
You'd marry into the family 
Well how can I tell until I've seen her 
She may look like her uncle 
Quite right I 
Oh no Diego She's a sweet little dove 
It would desolate us to have her leave the nest 
If she were Venus she'd still be his niece 
Yes but I'm not marrying His Excellency 
Oh 
Will you dine with us tonight Diego Charmed 
We'll expect you at eight o'clock 
Adiós señora 
Diego Diego what have you done 
An alliance for the good of the state my dear 
It's been fashionable since the dawn of history 
Oh María my knees are shaking 
Yes yes that is natural 
First the hand then the bow 
Don Diego Vega 
Well well well here you are at last 
Excellency 
Oh heaven spare me Señora 
I am dazzled 
And here is our little dove 
Lolita 
Charmed I'm sure 
May I present Señora María de López 
Señora 
Señor 
Life can be trying don't you think Yes 
Oh please 
Courage courage 
Well shall we dine 
Come Diego 
His bath was tepid 
Please do that again 
As you wish Observe closely 
Amazing 
Quite simple 
Have you seen this one No 
Now observe very closely 
Frightfully amusing 
Yes I did this one for His Majesty 
It must be heavenly at court 
It's the one bearable spot on earth my dear 
I was positively unnerved 
How distressing 
Apparently you don't approve of my request 
But you called her hero a cutthroat 
Santa María Have you met the fellow 
I've never so much as seen his face 
I happen to admire courage 
Hasn't been done since the Middle Ages 
It seems to be quite effective 
A madman that's what he is A madman 
Undoubtedly 
A rival 
He used to be a fencing instructor in Barcelona 
How exhausting 
I didn't find it so 
Then why did you give it up 
I had the misfortune to kill a man of influence 
A lady was involved I believe 
The gentleman's wife no doubt 
Just how did you mean that señor 
I'd hoped to be amusing Have I failed 
Somewhat With me 
Oh what are the new dance steps 
You know them all I suppose 
I'm afraid so 
I would so love to have you show me 
Gladly 
Inez would enjoy it more señor 
Nonsense my child Dance with him 
Que yo venga a padecer 
I never dreamed dancing could be so wonderful 
I found it rather fatiguing 
What's got into the girl 
Who knows 
Our little dove has flown 
I don't like it 
May I plead with you for her hand in marriage 
A refusal would crush me 
Who's there 
Zorro 
I have a confession to make Go 
You'll be caught 
I must talk to you 
Madre de Dios 
You you've done that without asking me 
What do you know about such things 
And it's time that you understood that 
Who's that 
No one 
Forgive me my dear I've been an old fool 
You 
Don't come in here 
I have something important to say to you 
So unlock that door and go 
About not hiding such beauty in a convent 
What did you say 
Oh no surely I must be dreaming 
You are Zorro 
Yes Lolita 
Oh yes I I see 
I understand You don't have to explain 
Oh go quickly 
Ride with me tomorrow 
Oh yes yes but go 
Diego be careful 
Lolita Open the door 
Yes I'm coming 
You seem upset my dear 
Have you been crying 
Yes I have 
I understand 
He's far too sophisticated 
I hardly know what to say 
Uncle Luis has done so much for me Nonsense 
Perhaps I could learn to tolerate Diego 
Oh I I do so want to please Uncle Luis 
We'll talk of this again in the morning 
Good night my dear Good night 
Past midnight He's not home yet 
How can you read 
It's the latest European styles 
Bustles are coming in it seems Bustles 
What is a bustle 
Oh it's something to 
Alejandro 
Well There you are 
What have you done about that girl Well 
A lovely unspoiled child 
You'll be delighted with her Father 
I'll be delighted with her What have you done 
What 
What a son you bore me 
Lolita Quintero 
She attracts you 
It's more than that 
From the day I first saw 
I thought you hadn't met her until tonight 
It's time you went to bed Very well 
But Diego tell me as soon as you can 
I will Mother 
What's the meaning of that 
Gonzales was collecting taxes 
A priest resisted The fool gave him ten lashes 
Send Gonzales to me I wish I could 
What's to prevent it 
Where 
To Hades I hope 
That should teach them 
What's that 
You 
What's that 
Sergeant Gonzales Excellency 
I think he's dead Dead 
Dead you say 
He's alive 
Zorro 
Padre 
José 
How is the little one She is well again 
I brought this to give thanks to the church 
Give thanks in your heart 
Buy milk for the child with this 
No Padrecito This is for the church 
Gracias Gracias 
Gracias 
I come at precisely the right moment it seems 
I'll take that 
These are the funds of the mission 
The property of the Church 
Not any longer 
Hand them over 
I refuse 
In that case I shall take them 
Santa María 
No wonder you chose the Church 
Run me through and have done with it 
Oh if I'd only left him in Spain 
I'll never see her I promise you that 
La Señorita Quintero 
Show her in 
So you defy me too 
You're not being sensible Alejandro 
Father this is Lolita 
And my mother chiquita Señora 
Señorita will you answer me one question 
Certainly señor 
Do you want to marry my son 
Why yes Why 
Well I 
You are right my son She is like the flower 
Diego 
Where is he now 
In the guardhouse at the barracks 
Oh Diego what can you do 
I don't know yet 
Look so far I've only frightened your uncle 
What are you doing here 
You frightened me half out of my wits 
Oh this is too much 
Leave us 
Where is Lolita 
No one seems to know 
I protest Your Excellency I protest strongly 
I can't discuss that now 
We arrested him today 
Gonzales was beaten half to death by this Zorro 
How frightful 
But after all it was harder on Gonzales 
Please this is no time for jesting 
What shall I do What shall I do 
I offer rewards and nothing happens 
Well he may change his mind about you 
Those creatures usually do I believe 
He may decide to cut the throat of someone else 
Must you always talk of throat cutting 
Oh how thoughtless of me 
What you need is a drop of brandy Brandy 
Yes yes brandy It's gone 
I'm surrounded by idiots 
Stupid servants stupid soldiers 
You know I admire you tremendously 
Your courage your fortitude 
You rang Your Excellency Yes brandy 
On the desk Your Excellency 
It's not on the desk Bring some 
Guards You follow me 
Look 
Look Your Excellency 
Zorro 
Here in the cellar right below my study 
Look here's his trail 
It goes this way 
It ends here 
He couldn't have gone through the wall 
Diego Diego Diego 
I'll do as he asks Pen paper 
Here Excellency 
A man should consider his wife 
This should do it 
This should suit that maniac 
There look it over 
That's very direct But you forgot to sign 
Sign what 
My resignation Esteban 
This Zorro will kill me if I stay 
What a pleasant coincidence 
I feel exactly the same way about you Capitán 
I might be tempted if I had a weapon 
Would you

Please don't bother It doesn't really matter 
Why not 
Thank you very much 
Oh I'll just ha have s some scrambled eggs 
What's happened to your friend 
Oh she's ill in bed with a cold 
I'm sorry I was so rude to you yesterday 
You weren't really 
You simply wanted to be alone and 
I didn't know companionship could be bought 
It said a friend of the bosom 
Chuckles   I don't envy you the privilege 
Haven't you any family 
How rotten for you 
You and your father 
Yes 
He was a lovely person very unusual 
What was he 
A painter 
Ah 
Was he a good one 
Well I thought so 
But people didn't understand him 
Yes that's often the trouble 
He painted trees At least it was one tree 
Do you think that's very silly 
Not at all I'm a fiirm believer in that myself 
You're going sketching this afternoon 
Yes Where 
I haven't made up my mind 
I'll drive you somewhere in the car 
Oh no please 
I didn't mean 
Thank you 
It's very kind of you but I'm not very hungry 
Oh come on Eat it up like a good girl 
But it can't be as bad as all that 
It's the perspective 
I never can get it right 
Let me see Oh dear 
Much more worthwhile 
Yes 
I went there once with my father on holiday 
Hmm 
I never have any fear of drowning have you 
Come I'll take you home 
I suppose I'd better have it 
Wretched stuff 
Give me a chocolate quick 
Oh there you are 
They say he simply adored her 
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth you know 
She was the beautiful Rebecca Hildreth you know 
But he's a broken man 
Bonjour Well where are you going

Off duty

Hurry up I want you to make some calls 
I wonder if Mr de Winter is still in the hotel 
May I go now 
Yes Mrs Van Hopper

And it never faded never got stale 
Oh all of them all these last few days

Better blow your nose 
I have a very impressive array of fiirst names

I'll dress in here I shan't be long 
Which would you prefer New York or Manderley 
Oh please don't joke about it 
I repeat what I said 
You mean you want a secretary or something 
I'm asking you to marry me you little fool 
Knocking At Door 
Is that my food 
I'm famished I didn't have any breakfast 
Ah my suggestion didn't seem to go at all well 
I'm sorry Oh but you don't understand 
It's that I'm not the sort of person men marry 
What on earth do you mean 
What is my sort of world 
Oh well Manderley You know what I mean 
Fine blow to my conceit that's all 
Oh I do love you I love you most dreadfully

You're very much in love with Maxim aren't you 
Yes I can see you are 
Does he like it like that 
But I wonder Maxim hasn't been at you 
He's so particular about clothes 
I don't think he ever notices what I wear 
You mustn't worry about old Maxim and his moods 
You seem such a placid little thing 
Good bye Giles 
Thanks for coming old boy 
We both really hope you'll be very happy 
Oh thank you Beatrice

Somehow I've hurt you 
Do you 
I've made you cry 
Don't I 
Yes let's forget all about it 
Hello Come in 
Oh please don't get up Mr Crawley 
What are you doing now 
Oh was that Maxim's idea 
Chuckles 
That's terribly nice of you 
Won't you sit down 
There was a man there a queer sort of person 
Jasper kept barking at him Oh yes 
Must've been Ben Excuse me 
Are those all Rebecca's things down there 
Yes Yes they are 
What did she use the cottage for 
The boat used to be moored near there 
What boat 
Yes It capsized and sank 
She wasn't afraid of anything 
Where did they fiind her 
Maxim went up to identify her 
It was horrible for him 
All the time whenever I meet anyone 
They're all comparing me with her with Rebecca 
That's very sweet of you 
We none of us want to live in the past 
Tell me what was Rebecca really like 
I suppose 
Good evening Maxim 
Have we time do you think before dinner 
Well what on earth have you done to yourself 
I hope you don't mind 
It doesn't seem your type at all 
Laughing   Oh I see 
Oh dear Oh dear 
Oh dear I'm sorry 
You look lovely lovely 
That's very nice for a change 
Shall we see these pictures 
Ah look now

Yes Frith what is it 
Excuse me sir 
May I have a word with you

Oh dear 
Robert is very upset This is trouble 
What is it 
What was the thing anyway 
The china cupid sir   Maxim   Oh dear 
Rrith   Very good sir 
Why do they come to me with these things 
The fact is I broke the china cupid 
I don't know 
I didn't like to 
I was afraid he'd think me a fool 
Well he'll think you much more a fool now 
You'll have to explain to him and Mrs Danvers 
No you do it I'll go upstairs 
It was all a mistake Mrs Danvers 
Is it possible to repair the ornament madam 
No I'm afraid it isn't 
It was smashed into pieces 
Yes yes all right 
I'm awfully sorry darling 
It was very careless of me 
Why on earth should you be frightened of her 
But I feel so uncomfortable 
Well what does it matter if they do 
I suppose that's why you married me 
What do you mean 
I I don't know 
I just said it for something to say 
Don't look at me like that 
Maxim what's the matter 
What have I said 
No 
It was rude hateful 
How do you mean 
I'm not much of a companion to you am I 
You don't get much fun do you 
Maxim why do you say this 
Of course we're companions Are we 
I don't know 
I'm very diffiicult to live with 
We're happy aren't we 
Terribly happy 
I'll go away 
Why don't you answer me 
If you say we're happy let's leave it at that 
Happiness is something I know nothing about 
Thank you very much 
I'll bring the sandwiches immediately madam 
Hilda Yes madam

Won't you have some tea or something 
Now isn't that a charming invitation 
It's been fun meeting you

That's very sporting of you 
I'm just a lonely old bachelor 
Fare thee well   Grunts 
Toodle oo 
Do you wish anything madam 
I didn't expect to see you Mrs Danvers 
Why did you say that 
I closed it before I left the room 
You opened it yourself didn't you 
Why did you never ask me to show it to you 
I was ready to show it to you every day 
It's a lovely room isn't it 
The loveliest room you've ever seen 
I'll show you her dressing room 
This is where I keep all her clothes 
You would like to see them wouldn't you 
Feel this 
It was a Christmas present from Mr de Winter 
I keep her underwear on this side 
Oh you've moved her brush haven't you 
Come on Danny hair drill she would say 
And then she would say 
Good night Danny and step into her bed 
Did you ever see anything so delicate 
Look you can see my hand through it 
Sometimes when I walk along the corridor 
I fancy I hear her just behind me 
I can almost hear it now 
Sobbing   No I don't believe it 
You look tired 
It's so soothing 
Listen to it 
Listen 
Listen to the sea 
Tell Mrs Danvers I wish to see her immediately 
You sent for me madam

Dudley Tennant Admiral and Lady Burbank

I don't want to know I don't want to know 
No one ever got the better of her never never 
It was the sea 
Oh stop it stop it Oh stop it 
Sobbing Continues 
A little air will do you good

Ben have you seen Mr de Winter anywhere 
She won't come back will she 
You said so Who Ben 
What do you mean 
Uh the other one 
Oh Frank have you seen Maxim anywhere 
Frank what's the matter Is anything wrong 
There is something wrong 
Frank is it 
Yes it's Rebecca's 
How did they recognize it 
He's a local man Knew it instantly 
It'll be so hard on poor Maxim 
Why did they have to fiind it 
All right Frank I'll go and look for Maxim 
Hello 
Maxim 
You haven't had any sleep 
Have you forgiven me 
Forgiven you 
What have I got to forgive you for 
For last night my stupidity about the costume 
Oh that I'd forgotten 
I was angry with you wasn't I 
Hmm 
Maxim can't we start all over again 
I'll be your friend your companion 
I'll be happy with that 
You love me very much don't you 
But it's too late my darling 
We've lost our little chance of happiness 
No Maxim no Yes 
It's all over now 
The thing's happened 
Maxim what are you trying to tell me 
Rebecca has won 
She knew that this would happen 
What are you saying 
They sent a diver down He found another boat 
Yes I know 
Frank told me Rebecca's boat 
Oh it's terrible for you I'm so sorry 
The diver made another discovery 
There was a body in there 
Then she wasn't alone 
That's it isn't it Maxim 
You don't understand There was no one with her 
Shuddering   Oh no 
I identifiied it but I knew it wasn't Rebecca 
It was all a lie 
I knew where Rebecca's body was 
How did you know Maxim 
Because I put it there 
You see 
I was right 
It's too late 
No it's not too late You're not to say that 
I love you more than anything in the world 
Oh please Maxim kiss me please No 
It's no use 
It's too late 
We can't lose each other now 
We may only have a few days a few hours 
Maxim why didn't you tell me before 
What are you talking about 
What do you mean 
I knew you were thinking 
This I did with Rebecca and this and this 
Oh it's true isn't it 
You thought I loved Rebecca 
You thought that 
I hated her 
She was so lovely so accomplished so amusing 
Breeding brains and beauty 
And I believed them completely 
But I never had a moment's happiness with her 
You didn't love her 
You didn't love her 
That was where I found out about her 
Four days after we were married 
Everything 
Things I'll never tell a living soul 
I wanted to kill her 
I frightened you didn't I 
You thought I was mad 
Perhaps I was Perhaps I am mad 
I'll make a bargain with you she said 
and people will visit us and envy us 
What a grand joke it will be 
What a triumph 
Scoffs   Family honor 
You despise me don't you 
As I despise myself 
Of course I can darling Of course I can 
Oh she played the game brilliantly 
But after a while she began to grow careless 
Then she started to bring her friends down here 
I warned her but she shrugged her shoulders 
What's it got to do with you she said 
She even started on Frank Poor faithful Frank 
Why didn't you tell me 
Remind me 
Chuckles 
As if I needed reminding 
Favell used to visit her here in this cottage 
But she was alone 
She was expecting Favell but he hadn't come 
She looked ill queer 
Suddenly she got up started to walk toward me 
When I have a child she said 
Then she started to laugh 
How funny How supremely wonderfully funny 
No one will ever know 
She was smiling 
Well Max what are you going to do about it 
Aren't you going to kill me 
I suppose I went mad for a moment 
I must have struck her 
She stood staring at me 
She looked almost triumphant 
Then she started toward me again smiling 
Suddenly she stumbled and fell 
But you didn't kill her 
It was an accident 
Who would believe me 
I lost my head 
I just knew I had to do something anything 
I carried her out to the boat 
It was very dark There was no moon 
I put her in the cabin 
I climbed over into the dinghy and pulled away 
I saw the boat heel over and sink 
I pulled back into the cove 
It started raining 
Maxim does anyone else know this 
No no one except you and me 
We must explain it 
No they're bound to know her 
Her rings bracelets she always wore 
Rebecca's dead She can't speak 
You can understand now what I meant 
I've loved you my darling 
I shall always love you 
No no she hasn't won 
No matter what happens now she hasn't won 
Hello Frank Hello Frank Yes 
Who 
What Oh 
What's happened 
Besides you weren't well at the time 
I was perfectly well 
Well don't let it worry you Maxim 
Nobody can blame you for making a mistake 
What do you mean 
The same formality and red tape Oh 
Oh yes the publicity 
Yes 
Why 
What would he know about it 
Well he's examining the boat now 
Purely as a matter of routine you know 
Yes Bye bye 
I have the evening papers madam 
Would you care to see them 
Yes I rather expected it would be 
Yes Frith It's purely a formality 
Of course madam 
But I don't think anything will be necessary 
Maxim 
Hello darling 
What do you mean 
You won't lose your temper will you 
Promise me that they won't make you angry 
All right darling I promise 
Don't worry dear 
They can't do anything at once can they 
No 
Then we've a little time left to be together 
Yes 
I want to go to the inquest with you 
I'd rather you didn't darling 
But I can't wait here alone 
I promise you I won't be any trouble to you 
All right dear 
I don't mind this whole thing except for you 
I can't forget what it's done to you 
Ahhh it's gone forever 
I killed that when I told you about Rebecca 
It's gone 
In a few hours you've grown so much older 
Sobbing   Oh Maxim Maxim 
BlackJack Brady was his name 
The most important arrest I ever made 
It must have been about two years ago now 
Of course there was no doubt about it 
He was hung a month after I caught him 
Hello wait a minute   Murmuring 
They've got old Balmy Ben up now 
She's gone Yes we know that 
She went in the sea The sea got her 
That's right that's right 
Eh 
Them cruel folks there 
Now nobody's going to send you to the asylum 
All we want you to do is tell us what you saw 
I didn't see nothin' 
Very well you may go Eh 
You may go now 
Mr Tabb would you step forward please 
I do so help me God 
No sir 
I often said Mrs de Winter was a born sailor 
What do you mean Mr Tabb 
I mean sir the seacocks 
What are the seacocks 
Yes 
What could be the reason for that 
Just this 
That's what flooded the boat and sunk her 
Are you implying 
That boat never capsized at all 
In her planking What are you talking about 
No frankly I would not but you never can tell 
You may stand down Mr Tabb 
Mr de Winter please 
Well of course I can't think of any reason 
You may believe what you like 
I know of no reason whatever 
Mr de Winter however painful it may be 
I have to ask you a very personal question 
I won't stand this any longer 
I presume you'll be available for us then 
I told you you should have had some breakfast 
Awfully foolish of me fainting like that 
Nonsense 
Darling please be careful 
Darling wait here a few moments 
Don't worry about me 
I'll be all right Sure All right 
Here have a spot of this Do you good 
Thank you 
Sure you're all right 
Yes of course 
I won't be long Right you are 
Ugh Hello 
And how does the bride fiind herself today 
I think you'd better go before Maxim gets back 
Oh jealous is he 
Well I can't say I blame him 
Perfectly splendidly 
It's no wonder What do you want Favell 
That's why I came down to the inquest 
Lunch 
I'm so sorry Do you mind if I put this there 
Talk what things over 
Those holes that were drilled from the inside 
Oh Mullen Yes sir 
It's almost empty Very good sir 
Does this bother you 
Am I boring you with all this 
No 
Good 
She wrote it to me the day she died 
By the way what do you do with old bones 
Bury them eh what 
However for the time being 
But it can be very very exasperating 
Hello Favell You looking for me Maxim 
Yes 
They may have a private room there 
Well see you later 
Come on Favell Let's go 
Have you a private room please 
Of course sir 
Through there sir Thank you 
Hope this will do Mr de Winter 
Any orders gents 
How about you Max 
Thanks 
Oh through the other door sir 
ColonelJulyan his is Mr Favell 
I only want to see justice done Colonel 
One of them of course is suicide 
Read it Colonel Jack darling 
I have something terribly important to tell you 
Of murder 
What else 
It's blackmail pure and simple 
Blackmail's not so pure nor so simple 
I see 
Have you any witnesses 
I do have a witness 
Oh It's that fellow Ben 
If that stupid coroner hadn't been a snob 
It's ridiculous even listening to all this 
Every time she faints in fact De Winter 
Maxim please De Winter 
That temper of yours will do you in yet Max 
Yes 
You might bring Mr de Winter a sedative 
No no nothing at all 
Just leave us Very good sir 
I knew you were going to bring that up Colonel 
Please let me stay Maxim 
But in my offiicial capacity 
I entirely agree with you Colonel 
Won't you sit down 
I don't know anything about that 
You knew she was in love with me didn't you 
She had a right to amuse herself didn't she 
There you see 
It's impossible She knows that as well as I do 
Who was it 
I don't know 
Oh I understand Danny 
Mrs Danvers it has been suggested 
Mrs de Winter was deliberately murdered 
There you have it in a nutshell Danny 
George Fortescue Maximilian de Winter 
There was a doctor 
Mrs de Winter sometimes went to him privately 
Dr Baker 165 Goldhawk Road Shepherd's Bush 
Go and question Dr Baker 
It isn't true 
It isn't true She would have told me 
No darling It'll be very tiring for you 
I'll be waiting for you 
Ready Maxim 
Yes 
You two go on ahead I'll follow with Favell 
My condolences 
Oh this is going to take hours 
I'm awfully sorry I'm afraid I can't help you 
I should have remembered the name de Winter 
I've never attended a Mrs de Winter in my life 
Did you say the 12th of October 
Yes 
Oh here we are No no de Winter 
Are you sure 
Danny What the devil 
Would you read that name again 
Did you say Danvers 
Yes I have a Mrs Danvers for 3:00 
What did she look like 
Can you remember 
Yes I remember her quite well 
Is that so 
This is a surprise I'd known her a long time 
What was the matter with her 
My dear sir there are certain ethics 
Come on out with it 
Yes I think I can 
She was not going to have a child 
I want to know the truth she said 
I don't want soft words and a bedside manner 
If I'm for it you can tell me right away 
I knew she was not the type to accept a lie 
She'd asked for the truth so I let her have it 
What was wrong with her 
Cancer 
Yes the growth was deep rooted 
She smiled in a queer sort of way 
Your wife was a wonderful woman Mr de Winter 
Verifiication 
Yes to confiirm the verdict of suicide 
Thank heaven we know the truth 
Dreadful thing dreadful 
Ayoung and lovely woman like her 
No wonder 
I wish I had a drink 
No thank you I'm staying in town tonight 
I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about 
Good bye Crawley Maxim's got a great friend 
Frank Yes Maxim 
There's something you don't know 
Oh no there isn't 
I didn't kill her Frank 
That's why she stood there laughing when she 
Don't think about it anymore 
Thank you Frank 
Hello Danny 
I just wanted to tell you the news 
Rebecca held out on both of us She had cancer 
Yes suicide 
Bye bye Danny 
Is this your car sir 
Yes 
Will you be going soon 
This isn't a parking place you know 
Oh isn't it 
When you phoned did she say she'd wait up 
Is something worrying you Maxim 
I can't get over the feeling something's wrong 
Frank 
What's the matter Why did we stop 
What's the time 
Oh this clock's wrong 
It must be 3:00 or 4:00 
Why That can't be the dawn breaking over there 
Frith Frith Mrs de Winter 
Where is she 
I thought I saw her sir 
Maxim 
Thank heaven you've come back to me 
Are you all right darling 
Are you all right Oh yes I'm all right

Well 40 
She had her face lifted

Don't try to make something out of it 
I didn't say Mrs Matuschek is not charming 
But I said she is What's wrong with that 
So the food was good

A letter from a girl 
and there you were lying in box 237 
I took you out of your envelope and read you

oh my dear friend 
What is all this 
You see I wanted to buy an encyclopedia 
Encyclopedia 
What're you talking about 
Tell me what has all this to do with the letter 
Address: 
Dear Friend Post Office 15 Box 237 
I know those ads The papers are full of them 
How long has this been going on 
We've exchanged four letters 
Four letters 
And she's no ordinary girl 
Now listen to this: 
Are you tall 
Are you short 
Are your eyes blue 
Are they brown 
Don't tell me 
What does it matter so long as our minds meet 
That's beautiful 
It is isn't it 
Now wait a minute 
We have enough troubles in our daily lives 
There are so many great and beautiful things 
to discuss in this world of ours 
it would be wasting precious moments 
if we told each other the vulgar details 
Mr Kralik 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
What do you think of it 
I think it's great Well open it 
No Mr Matuschek it's not for us 
I just don't like the idea 
I've been in this business for 35 years 
Mr vadas 
Coming Mr Matuschek 
Miss Novotni 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
Look here what do you think of this 
All I want is your honest opinion 
Well Miss Novotni 
I'd even go further 
Yes well Mr Kralik have you thought it over 
Yes I still think it's inadvisable 
Well give me one reason 
Let's say that a man smokes 20 cigarettes a day 
It's a perfectly terrible idea 
You sell things and let me do the buying 
Excuse me Mr Matuschek 
Yes 
Miklos yes 
Yes Mr Miklos 
Can I call you back in about five minutes 
I'd like a little more time to think about it 
No no it's not the price 
Yes 
Yes Mr Miklos 
What 
If that's the case then I'll have to say no 
I'm sorry 
Good morning madam 
Good morning 
A lovely bag don't you think 
Yes very 
It's an imported model 
I really didn't come in to buy a bag 
I beg your pardon What can I show you 
That's perfectly all right 
Yes thank you 
I wonder if I could see Mr Matuschek 
I could call him if you wanted 
I'd appreciate it Thank you 
Take for instance this compact 
Yes that's a wonderful bargain 
Everything in the shop is a bargain today 
Yes I imagine you'll be doing big business 
Maybe you could use me I'm looking for a job 
I'd like to but there's no opening 
Look around for yourself 
You can see what kind of business we're doing 
I beg your pardon 
Yes madam 
2 95 
Oh no 
May I tell you my qualifications 
Lf I could do anything for you I'd do it 
I'm not inexperienced 
I know the situation and there's no chance 
Even if you'd worked at Mintz and Kramer 
I did I took care of the finest clientele 
What trade do you think they have 
They'd take me back now 
Why don't you go back 
That's another story 
Then why don't you let me see him 
He's in sort of a bad mood today 
I'll take a chance Maybe I can cheer him up 
I can predict his every reaction 
Mr Kralik I beg your pardon 
Just one moment please 
It's all right 
So you know every reaction of mine 
You know me inside out 
You're not only a genius you're a mind reader 
Mr Matuschek

Something serious with your wife 
No she couldn't be better 
Why do you want to call him

Miss Novak 
Yes Mr Kralik 
Everybody else thought it was very becoming 
I don't remember remarking about your neckties 
My blouse is none of your business 
Yes that's right I'm working under you 
Imagine you dictating what I should wear 
I don't care what you wear 
For a circus pony it's all right 
I sold as much yesterday as anybody else 
Did you tell Mr Matuschek that 
Yes 
And what did he say 
Not to come in that blouse 
Tell him I won't 
I will 
Good morning 
Is this tie all right to wear to work 
Quite all right 
Tell me who is the girl 
Yes about the cultural subjects 
Yeah 
What else can you do in a letter 
She is the most wonderful girl in the world 
Is she pretty 
Don't say that 
I'm sorry The main thing is that you like her 
Yeah I hope I will 
What do you mean 
What 
You haven't met her yet 
No 
I keep postponing it and postponing it 
I'm scared 
Yes there is a chance 
On the other hand 
You might be disappointed too 
And I don't dare think about it 
Pirovitch did you ever get a bonus 
Yes once 
Yeah the boss hands you the envelope 
I'm meeting her tonight 8:30 in a café 
A red carnation 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I'm wearing one in my lapel 
I haven't slept for days 
I'm sure she'll be beautiful 
What do you want a homely girl 
No 
You knock on wood for me 
Just a lovely average girl 
That's all I want 
Thank you my good man 
'Morning everybody 
Thank you sir 
No Mr vadas I don't wonder 
What do you mean 
I mean I don't wonder 
Good morning Mr Matuschek 
This window looks terrible 
It's a wonder we get any customers 
I'll have to get out of it some way 
Klara you haven't got a chance 
With the light yellow dots 
I thought it was simply stunning 
I'm so glad I'm planning to wear it tonight 
Hello Yeah hello darling 
You came home late last night 
No I'm not angry Did you have a good time 
That's all that matters isn't it 
What 
1 000 pengo 
Yeah goodbye 
Come in 
What is it 
I'd like to talk to you for a moment 
Is it important 
It's important to me 
Is it important to Matuschek and Company 
Not exactly sir 
Pardon me sir 
What is it now 
Has it 
Yes Mr Matuschek it has 
After all I do my work 
And you get paid for it 
Yes sir 
Every month 
Yes sir 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
Did you see him 
I'm not going to stand for this much longer 
What does that man want of me 
Why does he always pick on me 
You are his oldest employee 
That's a fine reason 
What could I do 
I said Yes Mr Matuschek I'm an idiot 
I'm no fool 
Listen maybe he has business worries 
Or maybe he has some trouble with his wife 
Is that true Pirovitch 
Is he having trouble with his wife 
I don't know it's none of my business 
I'm talking to Kralik What do you want 
I don't know anything Leave me alone 
Not when millions of people are out of work 
I can get a job anywhere Can you 
Let's be honest 
I am I have a family 
Well I haven't 
Think it over 
Those were nice letters weren't they 
After all I'm a child 
No you don't have to stay 
Do you mean it 
I'll straighten it out 
Thanks Mr Kralik 
May I help you 
No thank you 
You don't have to keep harping on that 
No I didn't mean it that way at all 
Just what do you mean 
What do you think of me personally 
I try to be 
What a girl goes through in some shops 
That's why I like it here so much 
And that's my idea of gentleman 
Mr Kralik 
Yes Miss Novak 
About that blouse 
I'm sorry but I had to do that 
I want to thank you I'm glad you did it 
After thinking it all over you're so right 
That blouse was awful 
Oh no not awful 
Quite a change in you Miss Novak 
I know it Mr Kralik 
Thank you Mr Kralik 
That's quite all right Miss Novak 
I have a date with 
Tonight 
Didn't you hear what Mr Matuschek said 
We have to stay and decorate the windows 
I almost forgot 
Yes 
And then maybe Mr Matuschek would let me off 
I don't understand 
You want the night off 
I have to Mr Kralik 
You're out of luck 
You haven't been very nice to me either 
Whatever I do it's wrong 
If I wrap a package it's not right 
Here 
you don't listen 
You've taken my personality away 
You're a dictator that's what you are 
Mr Kralik I don't like you 
Mr Matuschek may I speak to you for a moment 
What is it 
Do you think you could spare me tonight 
Mr Kralik 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
Can you get along without Miss Novak tonight 
You want to go too 
Yes I'd appreciate it very much 
What is this 
Once a year I ask you to stay 
I'm sorry if I'd only known yesterday 
Did I ask you for your advice 
What do you mean you talked this over 
Who's shop is this 
Yes Mr Matuschek 
So you want the evening off Mr Kralik 
That's all right I think we can manage

Mama I called you 
Yes I knew you'd be glad Goodbye Mama 
Without any reason 
Maybe I have more reason than you think 
It's obvious that you're not satisfied with me 
You can draw your own conclusions

Me 
About leaving Matuschek and Company 
I congratulate you I wish you good luck 
I see you're reading Tolstoy's Anna Karenina 
Yes do you mind 
I didn't know you cared for high literature

Instead of a heart a handbag 
Instead of a soul a suitcase 
That's very nicely put 
Yes 
Meanness 
Let me 
Look if your party doesn't show up would I 
Don't worry about that My party will show up 
So you don't have to entertain me 
Have you read Zola's Madame Bovary 
Madame Bovary is not by Zola 
Mr Kralik are you still here 
Are you deliberately trying to spoil my evening 
Why do you want to do me harm 
Why do you hate me so 
I don't 
I suppose you love me 
Why should I 
What've you done to make me love you 
I don't want you to love me 
I don't 
Do you know what that tune reminds me of 
No no Wrong again 
It reminds me of a girl out of a job 
A very nice girl too I thought 
You thought that 
How you can lie 
Aren't you 
No I'm not 
Well I have information to the contrary 
That's a lie 
So that's the kind of a man you trust 
No 
I've never been to a tailor in my life 
That's what you did 
After you started making fun of my legs 
My hands aren't red at all 
No after I called your attention to them 
Let me tell you something Miss Novak 
An old maid 
So no man could fall in love with me 
Mr Kralik you're getting funnier every minute 
You little insignificant clerk 
Goodbye Miss Novak 
Goodbye Mr Kralik 
Doctor I would say it's a nervous breakdown 
What do you think 
Is that more expensive than a nervous breakdown 
Pardon me Mr Katona 
I would describe myself as a contact man 
Do you mean an errand boy 
Doctor did I call you a pill peddler 
Hello Mr Kralik 
How is he 
Is it serious 
It was a terrible shock 
I have to get over it 
Me Mr Matuschek and you Here 
Thank you for coming Kralik 
Sit down 
Now I have to take it easier 
Would you care to work for me again 
No don't even think about it sir 
Is it possible that I ever distrusted you 
I hated you 
I couldn't stand your presence any more 
That's how far jealousy can drive a man 
But that's all over now sir 
My wife 
But how could you suspect me sir 
You don't have to tell me 
When that poison gets into a man's mind 
Just try to understand 
I do understand sir 
Here are the keys to Matuschek and Company 
Thank you sir 
What shall I do about Mr vadas 
I want him dismissed as quietly as possible 
No scandal 
very good sir 
I know it will 
Yes sir Goodbye 
Kralik 
Yes sir 
Congratulations 
Thank you 
Goodbye Mr Matuschek 
Don't mention it It was a pleasure 
In other words you'd like to be a clerk 
I wouldn't put it that brutally 
When I get feeling better 
But then you might change your mind 
Who knows how long you'll have to stay here 
All right you're a clerk Now get out of here 
Thanks Mr Matuschek 
I want you to be a great success 
That's right 
If anybody deserves it it's you my boy 
Nice little ring isn't it 
My grandma gave it to me 
That's what you get when you're a good boy 
Some get apples I get diamonds 
Good one 
Yeah 
The black ones 
That's right and the big brown suitcases 
On the bottom shelf 
On the bottom 
You don't want to do it 
I didn't say that Of course I'll do it 
I'm a good soldier 
All right do it right away 
Thank you 
312 683 please 
Is this the Atlas Employment Agency 
All right 
Who made you a clerk 
Yes who did this dreadful thing 
Don't miss this folks 
Hello Mrs Matuschek 
Yes this is Pepi speaking 
That's right 
I didn't bring you that bottle of perfume 
Your perfume days are over Mrs M 
Yes This is Pepi speaking 
Now watch this 
That got her Draw your own conclusions 
You sent for me chief 
vadas I'm a little worried about you 
Working under a younger man 
You really think so 
Admit it You don't like me 
I don't 
Wait a minute Kralik You are the boss 
You know what I'll do 
I'm going to contradict you 
I do like you 
Anything else bothering you 
Yes I don't like you 
I don't think it'll be so hard 
No 
Hello 
Yes this is Matuschek and Company 
Johanna 
You're calling for Miss Novak 
What's the matter with her 
I hope it's nothing serious 
No there's no hurry now 
Really Kralik that's a wonderful attitude 
What's so wonderful about it 
I've been around and I have my eyes open 
Just leave Miss Novak out of this 
Not another word about Miss Novak 
You misunderstand me I didn't mean any offense 
I was agreeing with you 
I don't want you to agree with me 
You're fired 
Get out of here 
Folks Folks 
Folks 
Did you hear what he called me 
Remember it on the witness stand 
He called me a double crossing two timer 
I told you to get out of here Get out 
Don't you push Don't you push 
What right have you got to fire me 
Does Mr Matuschek know 
How do I know you're the manager 
Prove it to me in black and white 
You're going to get it in black and blue 
Get the man's salary 
Here it is Mr vadas 
We have everything prepared 
We don't want to waste any time 
Pardon me sir Your garments 
I'm entitled to a letter of reference 
I forgot it Flora take a letter 
To whom it may concern: 
Good morning 
Good morning Miss Novak 
I suppose you're surprised to see me back 
I hear you haven't been feeling well 
Here he is I'm Mr Matuschek 
Mr Kralik don't make any jokes Not today 
I don't know what to say 
Haven't you got any heart at all 
I'm not well I can hardly see straight 
Everything is just going round and round 
Excuse me 
Hello 
Hello Mr Foeldes 
Yes Well thank you very much 
Yes it all happened this morning 
No Mr Matuschek won't be with us for a while 
I'm only the manager 
Goodbye Mr 
Miss Novak Klara Klara 
Good evening Miss Novak 
Good evening Mr Kralik 
I hope you'll forgive this intrusion but I 
Anyway how are you young lady 
I'll be all right Mr Kralik Please sit down 
Thank you 
So you better get well 
I'll be all right in a day or two 
You 
Yes 
It wasn't your fault at all 
No there's a much bigger reason unfortunately 
Shouldn't you call a doctor 
No I don't need to see a doctor 
My trouble is what one might call psychological 
As long as it's only psychological you won't 
Only psychological 
Aunt Anna has something for you 
She has 
Why doesn't she come in Come in Aunt Anna 
This is Mr Kralik of Matuschek and Company 
I'm glad to meet you 
How do you do 
I hope it's good news 
I'll tell you later 
Mr Kralik it was kind of you to drop in 
I don't want to spoil your whole evening 
Don't worry about me 
Lf you don't mind 
Not at all 
Good news 
very good news 
I'll sell more goods than ever before 
With me 
Why 
Why 
Because you spoiled my date last night 
This gentleman did come to the café 
He thought you and I were friends 
He must have Listen 
Tell me and be frank I think you owe it to me 
Who is this very attractive young man 
He's just the type women fall for 
I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble 
It's all right I'll straighten it out 
It won't hurt him to be a little jealous 
I mean he walks away 
He's tactful He's sensitive 
And when you say old maid he says: 
Eyes that sparkle with fire and mystery 
vivacious 
Fascinating 
I remind him of gypsy music 
That doesn't make any difference 
You can consider one box sold 
Miss Novak you're taking an awful chance 
Why don't you give him a wallet 
I'm sure he'd be crazy about it 
I'm not interested 
I'd make you a special price 
No I'm sorry 
When he opens it there you are 
And that's all the music he wants 
Why Mr Kralik you surprise me 
That's very well expressed 
I must admit that's very nice 
There's not much more I can say 
Thank you Mr Kralik good night 
Good night Miss Novak 
Rudy 
Yes Mr Katona 
Do you know what time it is 
A few minutes after 8:00 
And you're still here 
Don't contradict me just listen 
Yes Mr Katona 
Am I asking too much 
No Mr Katona 
All right 
I have great news 
That's wonderful 
Can we visit him 
Now come on folks 
Where's Klara 
Klara Miss Novak 
Coming Yes Mr Kralik what is it 
How are you today 
Fine 
But don't overdo it 
Miss Novak may I ask a favor of you 
With pleasure Mr Pirovitch 
That's right I bought it for my boyfriend 
Mr Pirovitch can you keep a secret 
On my word of honor 
Maybe you never know 
What 
That's wonderful 
Then let's drop the whole thing 
I'm sorry can't you give him something else 
It's not so easy You see I don't like him 
The box costs 2 29 
No no Mr Pirovitch Speak freely 
That's hard to say 
That's an inspiration 
One of those imported pigskins 
That's what I was thinking of 
You can't miss 
On one side Here I'll show you 
Thank you Mr Pirovitch I'll think it over 
Kralik you'll get the wallet 
Mr Matuschek what are doing here 
Since when are you back 
And where do you think she got it 
And they expect me to get well 
Oh yes 
What kind of business are they doing 
They're busy but no comparison with this 
Good This is all right 
Mr Matuschek take it easy Don't overdo 
No I'm not don't be I'm not a fool 
Merry Christmas Mr Matuschek

That's wonderful 
I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart 
Thank you 
Pepi you know what I think about you

Klara 
Pepi

It's all right Rudy 
Too much 
Thank you 
Well Kralik 9 654 75 
That's wonderful 
Thank you Flora 
Have you ever been to Biro's 
No sir I'm afraid that's way over my head 
Christmas only comes once a year 
Mr Matuschek I'd love nothing more 
You have another engagement 
Have a wonderful time and Merry Christmas 
The same to you sir 
Well Pirovitch 
Yes I should say

That's all we want and we are very happy 
Well Merry Christmas 
Merry Christmas Mr Matuschek 
Merry Christmas Mr Matuschek 
Thank you Flora 
Please give my regards to your mother 
Thank you 
You'd better hurry home son 
Yeah 
I'm her Santa Claus 
Good night Mr Matuschek 
Good night 
After all I'm only working here a short time 
That's all right What was your name 
Rudy 
How old are you Rudy 
17 
It's up to you what you make of it 
Yes sir 
My people don't live here in town 
Is that so 
Have you no other relations here 
No Mr Matuschek 
You're all alone in Budapest on Christmas Eve 
That's right 
Rudy Do you like chicken noodle soup 
I certainly do 
I'd love it 
And then cucumber salad with sour cream 
Sounds wonderful 
It's lovely I'm sure he'll like it 
I think so too 
Thanks llona Good night 
I'm sorry I'll be out in a second 
That's all right no hurry 
I decided to follow your advice after all 
Want to see something 
That's beautiful 
Why don't you try it on 
I'd like to see what it looks like on a girl 
Are those real diamonds 
They're pretty near 
I didn't know you had a girlfriend 
Let's not start all over again 
Do you mind if I tell you something 
No not at all 
I got psychologically mixed up 
You don't say 
Yes 
I found myself looking at you again and again 
I just couldn't take my eyes off of you 
I hope you don't mind 
No not at all 
I can't believe it 
Yes and very much so 
You certainly didn't show it 
In those first few weeks 
Go on 
Now I'm getting psychologically mixed up 
That's a theater in France 
Yes you treated me like a dog 
But instead of licking my hand you barked 
Well that's all forgotten now 
Yes very 
Maybe we'll both be engaged Monday morning 
I think we will 
How do you know 
We won't go into that 
Mr Kralik what do you mean you know 
Who 
Your fiancée 
I spent an uncomfortable hour 
I can't get it into my head Coming to see you 
That doesn't sound like him at all 
I've straightened everything out 
Mrs Popkin 
Oh yes that's right Popkin Popkin 
A very nice fellow I congratulate you 
Thank you 
Yes For his type I'd say yes 
You would classify him as a definite type 
Absolutely And don't try to change him 
Don't put him on a diet 
Would you call him fat 
I wouldn't but that's a matter of opinion 
That's what you want in a husband isn't it 
Yes that's what I want 
And you're perfectly right 
Anyway he has a fine mind 
Didn't he impress you as being rather witty 
Out of a job 
He never told me 
That shows you how sensitive he is 
You have nothing to worry about 
Did you tell him how much I make 
He's your fiancée and he asked me 
This is terrible 
I could quote you passages 
For instance 
True love is to be two and yet one 
A man and a woman blended as angels 
He probably didn't mean a single one of them 
I'm sorry you feel this way about it 
I'd hate to think I'm spoiling your Christmas 
I had to come along and destroy it 
That's all right 
I guess I really ought to thank you 
We wouldn't have been fighting all the time 
It's sweet of you to try to cheer me up 
I think we'd better say good night 
Do you know what I wish would happen 
Please don't make it more difficult for me 
I'd say Klara darling 
No you mustn't 
Mr Kralik you must 
Dear friend 
You 
Dear friend 
Are you disappointed 
Klara 
Oh no 
No Yes I was Don't you remember 
I was going to prove to you that I wasn't 
I never know why men come back 
From sea 
The sea is cruel but the sea is clean 
The cause of this vast purity 
Must be 
That men at sea are few and far between 
And yet I ask why men come back from sea 
Oh oh oh oh oh 
The sea is cruel but the sea is clean 
Oh poor brown earth 
How kind you might have been 
The princess Have you got news for me 
No Master 
Dead 
She still sleeps 
You followed my orders 
Yes Master 
And the blind man 
He has been found 
Alms for the love of Allah 
Alms for the love of Allah 
A fine reward for charity 
If charity be false as that coin 
Then you cheat son of a burnt father 
A blind man cannot tell truth from false 
How can a dog tell bad from good 
See for yourself 
Now by the wonder of Allah 
It is a false coin and I myself knew it not 
Alms for the love of Allah 
Alms for the love of Allah Bring him to me 
Alms for the love of Allah 
Pray for me My name is Halima 
I do not know you 
Does one always know one's friends 
I have none to know 
In my house there is food and rest 
And what is mine is yours 
Why should you offer this 
For your prayers 
That is much for little 
Take my hand There's no need 
My dog sees for me 
This is a sleep beyond my knowledge 
I'll make him do it for me and cast him away 
But she loves the blind man 
Love she has yet to learn 
And I am here to teach her 
Poor blind beggar 
Even more unfortunate than you know 
That cannot be 
But we are unveiled 
And I am veiled 
Tell us your name 
Ahmad Ahmad 
Ahmad you'll beg no more 
Nor journey on Stay here with us 
There are great doctors here 
They may restore your sight 
That would be the blackest day of all my days 
You talk in riddles 
I will give you the answer Listen 
Be off 
Shall I call the khadi's clubmen 
Stop thief 
Stop that thief 
Ahmad the king 
Ahmad the king 
Ahmad the king 
Alas I was that mighty man 
Fifty palaces and I had no home 
Every desire satisfied I grew empty of desire 
Another execution 
Why had he to die 
He had been thinking my lord and master 
Is it a crime then to think 
In a subject it's quite unpardonable 
Are men only to be ruled by fear 
Do I want to conquer the earth 
What do you want my lord and master 
Tonight Jaffar 
Tonight my king 
Your people my king 
I've never been so close to them 
Go Listen observe and remember 
Why I don't know 
Is it the king he's talking about 
Don't ask questions 
There are spies everywhere 
You must be careful in Bagdad 
I'm a stranger here 
Only fools and children believe it 
A liberator indeed Not while Ahmad is king 
and this shall be the sign of him: 
And the reader of the Milky Way replied 
Have faith trust in Allah 
the lowest of the low mounted upon a cloud 
What is the name of the tyrant 
Ahmad 
I wish the miracle would happen today 
I wish he would die today 
Put him in prison 
Abu the little thief of Bagdad 
Don't put me in prison No 
Come in thief 
Cut off his right arm and then his left 
Then his left leg then his right 
Don't kill me 
I don't want to die Tomorrow morning 
Only his head 
As the sun rises 
Poor boy they've driven you mad 
Me mad 
They just said you were mad 
Are you really mad 
That's it I'm mad I must be mad 
You are mad quite mad What's it matter 
Didn't you hear the jailer As the sun rises 
To the isles of India and China 
And we're locked in prison 
The ax will fall as the sun rises 
And you say you're not mad 
What's that 
Give it to me Steady steady 
Why not 
We must wait 
Then we go 
Hurry Catch this oar 
Give me that rope Hurry We must get away 
Do you want us to be killed 
Do you think they will have mercy on us 
The king was a fool 
Do you hate him so much 
Everybody hated him 
Tell it now I am Ahmad the king 
Speak 
Ahmad the king is dead He died yesterday 
There's a new king Jaffar 
Look 
Jaffar would not make all that fuss over me 
He would not send the whole guard after me 
Mercy Master I'm your slave 
What's your name 
Get up my little friend 
We must return to Bagdad 
How can you be such a fool 
I mean my king would be killed 
I've had everything but freedom 
And I've had nothing but freedom 
In three days we shall be in Basra 
Take this pole Push 
I want to be a sailor     Sailing out to sea 
Aunts and cousins 
By the baker's dozens 
Can't you understand it 
Sailing to sea is life for me 
Is life for me 
Abu 
Basra 
How beautiful it looks 
How beautiful it smells 
Pancakes 
Give me one 
Really you are a fool 
Whoever heard of eating pancakes without honey 
But how can you steal honey 
You buy honey 
Jar 
Uh if it's good honey 
The best in Basra Uh easy to say 
First I must try 
I've tasted better 
What do you think 
No not good enough 
Your bees are out of humor 
Take better care of them 
Hey old friend Whose palace is this 
The palace of a thousand toys 
Toys 
Why toys 
But I say no more 
Allah be with you but I doubt it 
What's happening 
Let me go Not until you've told us 
The princess comes 
Why 
Is she so ugly 
Her beauty is like the sun and the moon 
Let me go 
Let us go Where 
Up there 
Your eating will cause our death 
Without eating we die 
Here they come 
I must see her again 
But I've found Sinbad the sailor 
And he has given us two places on his ship 
It is more wonderful than I'd ever imagined 
And on the next tide she sails 
I can't go 
I must see her again 
I can't go I must see her again 
I will 
O throbbing heart of mine 
Be still today 
We must await the word 
That all men say 
And when O heart of mine 
It comes to you 
Leap up     Remembering 
It might     Be true 
No more 
Are you afraid 
Yes Terribly 
Why don't you run away 
I want to look 
Well then what do you see 
You don't look wicked 
Are you a good djinni Not too good 
Do you live down there 
No 
Why have you come To see you 
I was about to bathe 
I'm waiting 
Bathe with you there 
Give me your hand then Down into the water 
I didn't mean you to go so soon 
Shall I never see you again Never 
Who are you 
Your slave 
Where have you come from 
From the other side of time to find you 
How long have you been searching 
Since time began 
Till the end of time 
His name is Death 
You mustn't come 
Forbid me then 
I cannot forbid 
Tomorrow 
And all tomorrows 
Did you see her 
No Abu 
I can't go 
Why not You have seen her again 
That's why I can't go because I have seen her 
All right Then I'll go alone 
Oh I'll find a way You'll be caught 
You'll stay with me 
Why should you stay with me 
Because I'm as great a fool as you are 
Brother of lions 
Fountain of hospitality 
And this is the most remarkable of them all 
I It tells the time 
See how it works 
Huh Sheer magic isn't it 
Dangerous 
Yes 
They will want to know how time is spent 
Oh you're right 
Oh the people must never know 
Look look Come Ah 
Such workmanship 
Such 
Such precision Such reliability 
I do so prefer these things to my subjects 
Watch 
Watch See 
That's the finest of them all 
See 
Near completion Huh 
Please do not misunderstand me 
But such a miracle does exist 
A mechanical toy better than than any of mine 
Oh I can't bear to be kept waiting 
Ooh This is exciting this 
If Your Highness would wind it yourself 
What's it going to do Hmm 
Move its legs or arch its neck 
Or Or wag its tail 
Hmm It doesn't kick does it 
It wants some winding 
And now 
Pull the reins 
I am no longer a man 
I am a bird 
I'm the king of birds 
I want it 
It's yours 
I ask but one thing in return 
Anything you will 
Your daughter 
My daughter 
Oh dear dear dear 
This is very awkward Wh 
What do you want my daughter for 
I have to found a dynasty 
Oh quite quite quite 
I understand entirely about founding a dynasty 
Delightful thing to do 
The true offspring of the mother of miseries 
Her eyes have quarreled 
They're always trying to get at one another 
Her body's straight as the letter alif 
How do you know 
I've seen her Oh no you 
I have 
Where 
In my crystal 
Oh confound your crystal 
Are you a magician 
I have some skill 
Oh say no more 
I Anyhow I I must have this horse 
I will never marry him I would rather die 
She will protect me 
Go back to the garden 
Yes Princess 
We have searched the whole garden 
We have found only two beggars 
Bring them here 
Jaffar 
Give me a sword 
Allah will judge 
Ahmad 
My eyes 
I'm blind 
Listen great sultan I know the truth 
You must know who this man is 
And this Listen good people 
Son of a dog 
And this is my curse: 
Yet without that hope there would be nothing 
And Allah is merciful 
If you mock me Allah will not forgive 
The richest merchant in the town bought her 
And you alone can bring her back to life 
Can you take me where she is 
O djinni shall I never see you again 
Never 
Lead me to her 
Why have you come 
To find you 
How long have you been searching 
From the beginning of time 
Till the end of time 
The dream my dream always the same dream 
This is no dream 
Ahmad 
Finish the masquerade 
Don't look at me like that 
Suffering has left its mark 
Your eyes They're so strange 
So full of pain 
One cannot go through fire and not be scorched 
Ahmad you must go 
The master has returned 
I'll bring her to you 
Quiet 
From now you're not only mine 
Stay and guard her for me 
Blind He's blind 
It is in your power to restore his sight 
Take me 
Is the doctor here on this ship 
Yes 
Open this door 
Bring him nearer 
Nearer 
How do you find your dog's life hmm 
Throw him overboard 
Welcome 
Jaffar 
Yes Jaffar It's always Jaffar 
Always Jaffar 
It was I who woke you 
No It was Ahmad 
But I am that doctor 
The same moment that I hold you in my arms 
Ahmad will see 
Take me in your arms 
My eyes 
Ahmad 
Can you see 
I'm Abu again 
Abu 
Abu where is she She's with him 
Jaffar on the ship 
What good are my eyes to me without her 
Is there nothing for you without her 
Nothing 
I have powers that could force you to my will 
But I want more than they can give 
I want your love 
Forget Ahmad 
He's no longer blind 
Only I am cursed that I can see only you 
Little fool 
Trying to end your life before it has begun 
I tell you Ahmad has forgotten 
Look 
It's Ahmad 
Wind 
Wind 
Wind 
Whip yourself winds of heaven 
Whip till you wail aloud 
Ahmad 
Why do you refuse to obey your destiny 
You behave like a slave girl 
I am a slave girl 
You could command me 
Try Ask what you will 
Would you take me back to Basra 
Master 
Northward to Basra 
This is a place of desolation 
It is the most beautiful garden in the world 
I'm not looking for my own reflection 
But my dear 
Don't let him take me 
Oh there there there there there there 
Never Never never never 
Never while I live There 
What is it 
The newest magical toy: the silver maid 
Does she do anything more 
She can embrace you 
But any of my wives will do that 
She tickles 
Guards 
Make ready for Bagdad 
Free 
Free again 
Free after 2 000 years 
For you 
For you this is the last moment of your life 
My life 
Your life 
I opened your bottle I let you out 
You can't be so ungrateful 
Ungrateful Slaves are not grateful 
Not for their freedom 
Are you ready 
Wait Wait Wait 
Please before I die may I 
May I ask one question 
Ask 
Oh no you weren't I was 
You weren't What 
You dare doubt 
Impossible And I don't believe you 
Take care 
And never shall Never 
Nothing can make me Nothing 
Nothing 
Unless I see it with my own eyes 
You shall see and believe 
Now you great overblown belch Let me out 
Let me out 
Let me out Let me out 
Product of inflation Descendant of a stink 
Let you out 
I'm going to throw you back into the sea 
This time forever Oh no 
Mercy Mercy O Master 
What's that 
O great and merciful master 
Say that again 
Three wishes 
I swear 
By King Solomon master of all the djinn 
No what No Master 
Now don't make so much noise again 
You frightened me before 
Master I hear and obey 
I'm hungry 
Can't think with my stomach empty 
Your sausages Master 
That was the first wish Master 
Two more remain Name them 
Don't you hurry me I've got to be careful 
Two more You know what I wish 
Tell me Where is my friend Ahmad 
Then give me the eye 
Steal Huh 
I'll see to that 
Little braggart What have you ever stolen 
And the tongue of a liar 
I always wanted to be a hero Come on 
Then catch on to my hair All right 
But mind you this is not my second wish yet 
Now I'm rather helping you 
Yes Master 
I hear 
All right Master 
I think so Where are we now 
Above the roof of the world 
Has the world got a roof 
Of course supported by seven pillars 
And the fish swims in the Sea of Eternity 
Where are we going 
A hero 
Help 
Is this the All Seeing Eye 
Not for 2 000 years will she grow another 
Look hard 
It's Ahmad 
Help 
Now my second wish Take me to him 
To hear is to obey little master of the world 
Don't be afraid Ahmad It's me Abu 
Put me down 
Gently you clumsy good for nothing 
He's mine and I am his master 
I am your master aren't I 
To hear is to obey O Master 
He brought me here and he'll carry us away 
Oh he's all right He's a bit big to talk to 
Hey you up there 
What are you laughing for 
For my freedom It is at hand 
You get us out of this place 
Your third wish 
Not yet 
He is big but he is sharp 
I've got to be careful Only one wish left 
I have only one wish 
Oh I know all about that 
Your princess 
If only I could see her again 
Is that all 
I don't need to waste a wish for that Look 
What's that 
Look into it hard hard 
Keep staring into it You'll see her 
It's true 
A blue rose 
I've heard about that 
That That's the Blue Rose of Forgetfulness 
Blue roses 
Exquisite 
Who are you 
I don't know 
I've forgotten 
Why have you suffered 
Have I suffered 
I don't remember 
It seems I was in love 
Whom did you love 
I cannot tell 
I don't know any longer 
I can't look anymore 
Nothing 
Why did you give me this 
I only stole it to help you 
You stole it because you enjoy stealing 
Without my stealing you'd be dead 
I wish I were dead I wish I'd never seen you 
I wish I wish I were in Bagdad 
I wish you were 
Ahmad 
Where are you 
Where you wished him on his way to Bagdad 
Then take me out of this place Don't you hear 
I want to get out 
You stay where you are 
If their brain speaks they forget their hearts 
And if their hearts speak 
If their hearts speak they forget everything 
Am I not your master 
Free 
And farewell little master of the universe 
Farewell Free 
You have been in love with me 
You are in love with me 
You will always love me 
Everything of the past is forgotten 
I have been in love with you 
I am in love with you 
I shall always love you 
Jaffar 
Put them in prison 
Chain them to opposite walls 
I have failed my love Forgive me 
I have no regrets 
We are together 
And shall be for the rest of our lives 
Abu and I parted quarreling 
I wish I could tell him I'm sorry 
Abu my friend good bye and forgive me 
I won't say good bye 
I'll help 
But how How 
If I can't help I won't see 
Welcome our prince 
Welcome little prince 
Father of a beard there's some mistake 
I'm not a prince I'm only a thief 
Who are you father of miracles 
And where am I 
We are the remnant of the Golden Age 
Golden because gold was nothing 
How did you become stone 
Here they are 
Aim this only at injustice and you cannot fail 
Oh no father of kindness I don't want it 
I don't want to be a king 
I only want to save my friend 
Well this will help you Take it 
And now 
I shall go to paradise at the hour appointed 
O Allah I know you don't much like stealing 
I'll never steal again You can trust me 
Aren't I right 
But I must go to Bagdad to save my friend 
It's a question of minutes You must see that 
O Allah lord of justice let me steal 
Fly carpet 
Wait 
Fly carpet 
Why do you close your eyes 
There's little time left to see him 
And the reader of the Milky Way replied 
Have faith trust in Allah 
the lowest of the low mounted on a cloud 
The horse 
Up quickly 
Ahmad 
Jaffar 
Where are you going 
You've got what you wanted 
Now I'm going to find what I want 
What's that 
Some fun 
An adventure at last 
Have a pass Yes sir captain 
Sam Moore 
What's your business Sam 
Going to visit your wife 
No sir 
I was going away from her and fast too 
All right 
Let him through Giddap Dolly 
Step aside for the stagecoach 
Hello Ted 
How many you got 
Three sergeant and a lady 
Your passes please 
Mr Colburn Army sutler 
Judge Hatfield Oh good morning Your Honor 
John Goodrich merchant of Richmond 
And the lady Julia Hayne Virginia City Nevada 
To visit the commanding officer at Libby Prison 
You got folks in there 
I'm a Southerner 
The commander's my friend Sorry ma'am 
All right gentlemen Thank you very much 
Go ahead Ted 
Let them through 
Let them up 
That last shift didn't do so badly 
Forty four 45 46 47 48 
That means we've passed the powder magazine 
Yeah and it lays rights over here 
How much further we got to dig captain 
Oh about five more feet 
Only eight more hours till we're free 
Gosh my pa must have been a beaver 
He probably was 
Guard Yes sir 
Open up 
Them Union prisoners sure is savage 
Do as I tell you and lock the door behind me 
Yes sir 
You up 
Okay 
You on your feet 
You too 
And you 
All right you four men move it 
Come on move the stove 
Yes sir Yes sir 
Now clear out 
No no 
It's no use 
Now get back and look out for yourselves 
What are you doing 
All right you men Come on out 
You hear me Come on out of there 
That tunnel wasn't a bad idea 
Three months and almost 13 days 
And you let us go on working did you 
This time it's final 
If you'd like to dig further you're welcome 
That's all No no 
That's not quite all captain 
I'll be at your service and it'll be a pleasure 
Captain there's a lady waiting inside 
Julia 
Julia 
I wondered if I'd ever see you again 
Haven't you forgotten 
Forgotten 
How could I 
But I've changed 
Not to me 
And you Vance 
What's been happening to you 
Of course I knew you were here 
Certain people in Virginia City told me that 
That's simple enough Here sit down 
Thank you 
Vance the war's going badly for us isn't it 
Very badly Julia 
Wars are won with gold nowadays not with men 
And the North has the gold 
That's why Sherman's in Atlanta 
Who's going to stake us 
Jeff Davis is bankrupt 
I'm not thinking about credits Vance 
Julia you're crazy 
That's a Yank stronghold and 
Of course 
That's why I've come straight to you To me 
Yes you're the only one who could do it 
Is that the only reason you came straight to me 
I don't know Vance 
I still don't know 
But you're my oldest and my dearest friend 
I knew I could trust you 
Was it because of me 
Well partly that then because I wasn't sure 
I wanted to sing 
Father was so furious 
A Hayne on the public stage 
You gave a recital in Boston I heard 
Only one 
Then the war 
But why 
Virginia City is a loyal Yankee nest 
Drunken Union soldiers talk and I listen 
I'm a very good listener Vance 
And what I hear I pass on 
To get your help 
Oh so much depends in you Vance 
You must go and see the president 
Mr President we must face the facts 
If you'll permit me to demonstrate on your map 
Go right ahead sir 
It makes sense to me Mr President 
Well General Page 
If Captain Irby says he can he will sir 
One moment sir 
Julia the president would like to see you 
Mr President 
I knew your father Miss Hayne 
Thank you Mr President 
We're proud of you and deeply grateful 
Good luck to you captain 
The hopes of 10 million will be riding with you 
Quiet 
Right The lamp 
There it is Yeah Here 
Hey not yet 
Wait until the sentry changes at 10:00 
What are they digging 
Earthworks the last line of defense 
Is it as bad as that 
Are they so close 
Seventy miles at Spotsylvania Court House 
Who's billeted here 
The 17th Cavalry 
They're using it as headquarters 
They'll probably move on any day now 
Looks strange doesn't it 
Oh Vance do you remember the old days here 
The parties father used to have in this house 
It was fun growing up together wasn't it 
What have I got left 
The war's taken everything 
Not me Julie 
Perhaps someday we 
When do you start west 
I won't forget 
What time is it 
Around 10:00 
Let's go back to Richmond 
The prison 
Back to town as quick as you can make it 
Here are some tracks men 
Come on 
Come on 
I question that sir 
That's correct The shipments were made 
Only one place sir 
Virginia City 
That's a rebel hotbed 
By the way I'm taking these men with me sir 
We always work together 
Well what are their qualifications 
Yes sir 
You mean Kansas City sir Oh Kansas City 
And Moose Yes sir 
Well that settles it 
Draw what money you need from the paymaster 
Thank you Good luck to you 
Thank you sir 
Sir Sir 
Hey why did you say I only had four wives 
Well what was it five 
Sure 
Oh I keep losing count 
He's kind of busy right now 
Life insurance 
Fine protection 
Oh sure sure I just sit home reading books 
Oh you Westerners are lucky 
No taxes to speak of nothing to worry about 
You are lucky to be out here 
Yes they are 
That's the part of the war I don't approve of 
What business are you three gentlemen in 
Well We're in the mining business 
Yes but We're in both 
That's it 
You haven't said 
Haven't I 
Cattle business No no 
Maybe you could say I handle hardware 
Full line Oh full enough 
Hardware 
Here is one of my samples 
You take this Mr Marblehead 
I'm a trifle gun shy 
No no no not me I never touch them 
All I want's a pocket full of rocks 
Guns are for warlike people What made you ask 
Did you ever hear of John Murrell No 
Who is he 
You mean Murrell's guerrillas 
Sure we've heard of them 
They're a pack of murderous skunks 
Hey you are right 
Beautiful work don't you think 
Yes 
These things make me nervous 
Thank you 
This is his stamping ground 
He wouldn't dare hold up the United States mail 
Murrell wouldn't be after the mail 
Quickly 
Now you 
I take it you're Mr Murrell 
But that's the point I don't please 
It won't go off 
Would you like to bet 
Oh please Mr Bradford 
Why Miss Hayne 
Such solicitude is very touching 
You were saying sir 
Guerrillas Yes Murrell's guerrillas 
I think I outdraw you eh mister 
Don't reach for that 
Get them up 
See if he's got another gun Moose 
Give me that stuff Give me that money 
You leather headed Your purse madam 
I'll say he's in the hardware business 
Driver 
Driver pull up 
Come on 
Put up your guns boys 
You go back and don't follow He means business 
What makes you think I would 
Hope three ain't crowding 
Keep my hands on him you mean All right son 
Bess Dolly 
Oh he wasn't as tough as my last wife 
Only four times 
Five 
All insured I hope 
Never mind 
I'm all upset 
How about you ma'am 
Why the night we started the dig 
What 
Pardon me 
I was silly wasn't I 
But I was rude Sorry 
I deserved it 
I haven't said thank you 
Don't you believe in predestination 
You had to be here too so did Murrell 
There's probably future reason for it 
Hey Kerry 
That's a lot of money for buzzard bait like him 
You have not collected yet 
Murrell's loose 
Doggone the dad burn it Stuck in the creek 
All right folks unload and give us a push 
This is a dreadful situation 
All right folks unload and give us a push

Don't put me here There you are 
Now then you stay there 
Hey Watch that there rock

I hope you're right 
Look Johnny 
It's a small world isn't it 
I didn't know you for a minute Bradford 
Maybe it's the fresh air in here 
What are you doing out here in Nevada

Why 
Do you know a man named Irby 
Were you looking for me

It's just to fix my arm 
Why do we wait Do something for me quick 
All right 
Bring him in here 
Will you help Vance 
Marshall Robert Gill Cameron 
All right 
It worked pretty good for a snake bite 
Then it should've worked for you but it didn't 
It's a good joke huh 
You 
You know me who I am 
No I'm thinking of one you can collect 
You see who is there 
If he's smart man get rid of him 
Get over there you 
Are you Doc Cameron

We can't tell from here Who you got in there 
A patient with a smashed shoulder 
Just a second doc

Just a second doc 
I had the measles once 
Thank you doc That was nice work 
You lie almost so good like me huh 
They're looking for me Murrell 
For you

I'll give you $ 10 000 to do a job for me 
What kind of job 
Listen here's what I want you to do 
Oh you 
For being disappointed in me 
Well I suppose you couldn't help it 
No it wasn't that 
But it was such a surprise seeing you up there 
That's a funny thought 
I'd probably get mixed up in my skirts 
You know what I mean though don't you 
Yes I know 
Have you told me everything 
No I haven't You're right 
I just made a silly fool of myself I'm sorry 
Will you forgive me 
I forgave you a long time ago 
Maybe 
Maybe I even wanted you to care that much 
That's all I wanted to know 
Well Virginia City's a dangerous place 
Besides there's a war on and 
Yes there's a war on 
Could I see you for a moment sir 
Yes 
Excuse me 
What is it 
Good we'll take a look around Wait here 
I'll be right with you Yes sir 
Is that why you came here 
I can't tell you about it now darling 
Remember that always will you 
Close that door 
Vance 
Lock it 
Why did you risk coming here 
Bradford's downstairs now looking for you 
Yes I saw him 
He found the hideout 
But how can we 
Remember Murrell the outlaw 
I made a deal with him 
His gang is camped a few miles from here 
That'll draw every soldier out of Virginia City 
Waiting for us 
But you can't stay here now Julia 
Or would you rather stay 
Why I have nothing to stay for Vance 
Of course I'm going with you 
What is it Vance 
Send him to you 
What for 
The only way to stop that is to grab him first 
What are you going to do with him Vance 
I don't know yet 
You're going to kill him aren't you 
Of course you are 
That's something only a woman could do 
We are very proud of you and deeply grateful 
I remember 
I remember 
Oh but why must I be the one Vance 
Can't you see this is murder 
It's even worse than murder Kerry trusts me 
And what about those who are trusting us 
Yes 
What shall I tell him 
Now listen 
All right we'll spread out from here 
Moose you take the north section 
You men check everything up that way 
Come on Marble we'll look around here

Well would you mind if I looked around 
You can take a look at this

You can hardly blame them for trying 
You mustn't go on with the search 
Please 
For my sake 
I love you darling 
I'm so afraid for you 
I love you too Julia 
I couldn't do it Don't you see

There's the river Water 
This is the river we hoped for 
Mud 
How far to the next stream Vance 
If this one's dry they all are 
We mustn't let the others know 
Means too much to them 
We haven't reached it yet 
You go back to the wagons John and tell them

I'm afraid we'll have to go further on 
I've got a job to do 
I know 
Julia you don't regret anything do you 
Regret 
What do you mean 
You've changed 
You've been different ever since 
Tell me what's on your mind 
Oh it's just these people they can't go on 
We can't make them Vance it's inhuman 
War is inhuman Julia 
Two maybe three 
That doesn't matter 
We gotta get through 
Come on Julia we're moving 
Come on 
Cobby Gill age 11 
It must have been pretty tough for him 
For one of them especially 
You sure was right about that gold train Kerry 
That's the way they're headed all right 
Walton Brown 
I figured we'd run onto them about here 
You figured 
Didn't I tell you 
You see 
Who's that 
Dismount 
Take these horses and keep them out of sight 
That bunch is all tired Wore out 
Maybe we give them little surprise huh 
The rest of you stay here and keep them covered 
Bed down your horses and start your fires 
Watch the children 
Hold on Murrell 
Hello What do you want here 
I have some business to talk with Irby 
He's finished his business with you 
Maybe he thinks so but not me 
You named your price and we paid it 
Now get out of here 
It's Murrell 
Doggone tarnation 
It's the Yank Bradford 
Hold your fire men 
Let them come in 
Don't shoot at them 
Hold your fire 
Thanks Irby Forget it 
This turned into a pretty good fracas 
How'd you learn to wing shoot 
In Afghanistan the kids do it 
How much ammunition have you got 
Plenty 
Vance 
Oh Vance Let's get his shirt open 
Yes 
That's a bad one Dr Cameron 
Bradford Yes 
You take command will you 
Right 
Don't worry Yes 
Get him comfortable doctor 
We'll get him on a cot Vance 
That's right Julia 
Come over here Follow me quick 
Come on 
All right 
Once more 
Now we hold off until daylight 
Better build that barricade higher 
Get a little sleep if you can Vance 
Thanks doc 
Too bad Irby 
I'm sorry 
I was hoping you'd come 
What's our chance of holding out 
Not much frankly 
When 
Tomorrow maybe Maybe not for days 
About the gold 
It's cost us so much 
So would I but that's not up to me 
No it isn't 
It was your job to get us and you did it 
I thought because of Julia you might 
I promise you one thing though 
Murrell won't get it 
That's all I can promise 
Where is it 
Under the floorboards of the wagons 
Right 
I think we might have been friends 
Thanks 
Marble 
Moose 
How is he 
How's Irby 
Oh he's pretty bad poor fella 
I don't think he'll make it 
He told me where the gold is Where 
Look get every able bodied men in camp 
Get all of that gold into the first wagon there 
Boys come on 
You two men go with them 
Dr Cameron Yes what is it 
How much gunpowder have we got 
Kegs of it 
Get out two kegs and a length of fuse 
What are you trying to do 
We're moving the gold 
What for 
What are you gonna do with it 
I haven't time for explanations now 
So you're taking the gold and running out on us 
Come on Here hitch this horse up 
Who told you where the gold was 
Irby 
Oh I'd rather Murrell got it than the North 
I don't use those people who trust me 
There'll be a certain rough justice about that 
What do you know about justice 
What do you know 
I'm sorry we don't understand each other Julia 
Come on We're all loaded Kerry 
All right Marble you take the lines 
Don't let her sink in the sand Come on 
Right one more keg 
Now the fuse 
There it is 
Come on 
I got him for you Yank 
Father 
Father 
You dirty rat 
I'll kill you I'll kill you 
They killed him They killed him 
Think it's gonna rain 
It always does 
Here Hold this 
Follow me 
They ain't shooting Watch them fall 
Vance 
How many men did you lose 
What you see here is all that's left sir 
Is the gold safe 
Well where is it 
Let's have a look at it 
There isn't any gold 
Is this your idea of a joke Bradford 
Answer my question 
Have you searched the wagons 
I told you sir there isn't any gold 
Why that's absurd 
What have you done with it 
Who are you holding it for 
Just a minute Bradford 
Yes sir 
You're under arrest 
Yes sir there is something I'd like to add 
This was one of them 
And I performed it to the best of my ability 
I knew that if it did it'd prolong the war 
The gold did not reach the South 
That was not enough 
That's true sir 
Well I made that choice 
And what has this to do with you 
Continue 
Except that I believe I'm doing the right thing 
That's why I refused to deliver the gold 
That's why I still refuse 
Captain Bradford that's your final decision 
Yes it is sir 
I I can't tell you 
I've no words to 
Oh I'm so deeply grateful for this audience 
I know how busy you are Mr President 
I've sort of missed them these last four years 
That's less than six hours in Nevada 
I know that I heard them say so 
I was there 
He mustn't 
He can't be killed 
I'm not a military man my child 
He won't be killed 
Thank God that the killing is over 
Then we've lost 
Not lost found 
They're coming back back in the Union 
I think very likely you're in love with him 
Mr Lincoln I didn't know you were like this 
I want to tell them in Virginia everywhere 
Yes tell them we're not enemies but friends 
With malice toward none with charity for all 
Juanillo Yes Mother 
Go to sleep Yes Mother 
I Curro tell you you didn't need your sword 
You killed that bull with your cape 
I got that in uh— in Bilbao 
I've killed 2 912 bulls

It's useless to predict a future for him 
Well I— I guess I came back a little too early 
But you saw me fight bulls a long time ago

It doesn't matter But it matters to me 
No no I'm gonna save this

Not today 
I Curro— 
He fought a Miura bull as big as a cathedral 
I have the clipping right here with me 
Rejoice ye faithful 
There's an end to the decay of our great art 
We are on the eve of a great renaissance 
Cid Campeador has returned 
to bring back the glory of Spain 
Olé Olé At last Sevilla has a matador 
The greatest matador of all history 
A saint The first man of the world 
Olé Olé 
He was so near the bull next day 
Olé Olé 
Gorgeous It must cost a fortune 
What a corrida 
Ah his cape work was magnificent 
I tell you he had it on a string 
Remember 
Yes I've carried the scar ever since 
You said I was definitely fifth rate 
Curro have you ever been hungry 
Never I've frequently been thirsty 
Well I can tell you this 
Now I'm ready for the grave 
I've just come from the drawing of the bulls 
We've got something on our hands this afternoon 
Sluggish treacherous— What difference 
A bull's a bull 
They're all alike to Juanillo All safe 
But you maestro— 
Olé Olé 
That's what I say 
Good luck senor 
Gracias 
Parasites 
Wait for me in the carriage 
Hot isn't it 
The taste of death 
Fear 
But it's gone when I step into the arena 
How do you feel Good as bread 
And you 
Oh I wish it were this time tomorrow 
You've gotta learn not to worry 
At last Sevilla has a matador he said 
My jacket 
The greatest matador in history he said 
I've kept my promise haven't I 
He said I was the first man of the world 
That makes you the first lady 
Well how do I look

Or a little boy all dressed up for a party 
I wish you were gonna be there with me 
I'm always with you Juan 
My heart stops beating 
You're the only true one in the world 
Now go 
Does it save them from being gored by the bulls 
Sometimes 
There's no guarantee not even from the saints 
Who is that 
I don't know A new one 
Every ticket has been sold 
You're lucky to be here this afternoon 
You'll see history made 
Before Gallardo and After Gallardo 
I Curro say it 
I see she's back from Paris 
Who is she 
Dona Sol de Miura 
Since you've been away a new star has arisen 
His name is Juan Gallardo 
Charges straight Favors the left horn 
Olé Toro

I'm through with this rotten business 
I swear to you this is my last season 
Ah Carmen 
Oh where—where are the newspapers 
Now come here now There 
Who did you dedicate the bull to yesterday 
Then why did you dedicate it 
She threw me some flowers I hate her 
Was she pretty 
Mmm not bad 
Prettier than me 
That's impossible 
Then I don't hate her anymore 
Still she uh— she wasn't so bad 
Blue eyes and uh— I don't like her 
But too skinny I guess she's all right 
Come on now Eat your breakfast 
Did I Mm hmm What became of it 
I don't know I must've left it somewhere 
Come in 
Will you read it for me Mm hmm 
Who's it from 
Oh well then tear it up 
What's it say 
The address is Number Four Plaza de Alfaro 
Oh yes it all comes back to me now 
She seems willing now 
Oh Why shouldn't you call for it 
She must be his niece 
What does she look like 
I don't remember Just a woman 
Let's not argue about it I'm not going 
You're not 
No Oh I'm glad Glad 
A moment ago you were just saying— 
As long as you don't want to go you can go 
Give me that note 
All right 
Mmm What are these 
Potatoes 
They're so small 
You ever eat that 
I don't think so I was raised on it 
Really 
How is it made 
Then you throw them all in a pot— gazpacho 
Sounds lovely You oughta try it sometime 
I will Dona Sol likes to try everything 
Yeah me too 
If I were a man I'd try bullfighting 
There's nothing more exciting 
Oh this is fine meat What is it 
Senor may I ask what brand of perfume you use 
I like the smell of horses and bulls 
Senor Gallardo I hope you'll join us 
Where are you going 
He's giving a concert and if you'd care to go— 
No thank you Not me 
I'm afraid I'll have to beg out too 
One of my nasty headaches 
Oh That's too bad 
I hope you feel better soon Thank you 
Please explain to Tito He'll understand 
I'm sure he will We all do 
I am so sorry about your headache 
Yes of course 
Well good night

Good bye 
If I want you I'll call 
How's your headache Better thank you 
Hmm Well I— 
Please sit down 
You followed your star yesterday 
You were inspired 
Mmm Who wouldn't be inspired I'd seen you 
I wasn't bad was I 
Would you like to play chess 
No thanks 
I'm much too comfortable 
Matter of fact I don't know how to play chess 
I'm glad you decided not to go to the concert 
So am I 
Perhaps we can have a concert of our own 
You play something The guitar a little 
Do you like music 
Some music yes 
Play something 
Here Oh that's beautiful 
Oh that's too gorgeous for words 
I looked all over Sevilla for it 
I wanted to give you something especially fine 
But why dear What's happened 
Why did you get this for me 
Perhaps if you'd give him a son or two— 
If he'd only take my advice 
Just what have you done for him 
What has he done for me 
Why everything 
Who says it's his house 
He and his fine gestures 
Buys a house and doesn't pay for it 
It might interfere with his evenings 
He's a lazy drunken worthless— 
You ingrates Hypocrites Maggots 
He gave you everything you have 
He supports you and your children 
You pick at him like vultures 
I can't stand it in this house any longer 
I'm going away 
No Carmen no You'll stay 
You'll stay with Juan until the end 
The end 
To Our Lady of Hope La Macarena 
What do you ask La Macarena 
So I used to pray for his father 
It was no good 
In the end it was no good 
The Virgin— She's only a woman 
And women can do so little 
Now I pray to a man God— 
Jesus of great power 
What I ask is something different 
Madre what do you ask for 
Yes that's what I pray for 
He'll be safe and sound my child 
That too when the time comes 
I know what it is 
I can read it in your heart 
Why I didn't mean to 
Really I didn't 
It's just that I didn't want to hurt Juan 
Dear Macarena help me Please help me 
Tell me what to do about that woman 
That woman— 
¡Ajá toro 
¡Ajá toro 
¡Ajá ajá toro 
That's good Very good 
¡Ajá toro

I came to see you on the advice of a friend 
Yes Please be seated 
Thank you

Oh 
I'm not here to judge 
Thank you 
Perhaps it's my fault 
What have you heard 
Shall I be frank

Maybe that's why I want so much to keep him 
Tell me have you discussed this with Juan 
No Why not

Just a minute please 
¡Ajá toro 
Oh good morning Madrecita 
Good afternoon my son 
Where's Garabato 
He's gone 
Gone 
You let him go last night 
Don't you remember 
What was it 
He asked for his wages 
You haven't paid him in months 
He had an offer from Manolo de Palma 
Why wasn't he paid 
Why didn't Don Jose attend to it 
I don't know 
I don't understand it 
The more money I make the less I seem to have 
It melts away before I ever see it Yes 
One can't build on sand 
I'll answer it 
Good afternoon Juanillo Don Jose 
I've been in the country over at the ranch 
There's something I want to talk over with you 
Well uh make yourself comfortable 
How is everything at the ranch 
I saw Carmen How is she 
Let's not talk about that 
What's the use 
She had a right to leave and she left 
That's all there is to it 
Is it 
Did you want her to leave 
No 
Do you still love her 
Yes And the other one 
That's an entirely different thing 
I'm sorry for Carmen and I pity Dona Sol 
Why should you pity her 
Nothing 
Now my advice to you— 
From me Senor Lopez 
And I can tell you this: 
Nothing 
You haven't even paid for the house you live in 
I understand 
Good bye rats 
But you're mistaken if you think I'm sinking 
Well what are you waiting for 
Rejoice ye faithful 
At last Sevilla has a matador 
The greatest matador of all history 
A saint 
The first man of the world 
The day he was born there was salt in the air 
A great quantity of salt 
They scream with a lust for blood 
As soon as I can collect my back wages 
I'm going to quit this repulsive trade forever 
I swear this is my last season 
It's not the bulls It's the crowd 
They're waiting for me with claws 
And fickle like a woman and cruel like a woman 
You aren't giving them anything 
Well I've— I've had bad luck 
The bulls have been much bigger 
She took it away from you 
There's nothing left of you but fear 
You have a gun haven't you 
In the end there's only one thing I regret— 
I never learned to read or write 
What 
We've always shared everything haven't we 
Life is very curious 
There's no remedy 
If it were all to do over— 
Well I'm quitting 
This is my last season 
And I end by heralding the news 
Olé 
It is destined for great glory 
Curro wrote it himself huh He signed it 
You'll be famous Wonderful 
Don't leave Oh Manolo 
Aw quiet 
Senor Curro Manolo 
No you must do me the honor 
Curro what is a comet 
Yes 
Good evening Don Juan Good evening senora 
This way if you please 
What will you have 
What will you have 
Champagne Champagne 
Champagne Sí champagne 
It's a nice place I'm glad we came here 
What is it Juan 
Yes 
Well one changes you know 
I had a headache 
A headache 
Samson and Delilah 
What 
Nothing 
Excuse me 
What promise 
Why to present me to Dona Sol 
How nice I shall look forward to it 
I understand Juan will be in the same corrida 
Yes it'll be the first time we appear together 
You'll have a chance to compare our styles 
We work altogether differently 
How have you been amigo 
Well thank you 
How's your mother 
Nicely 
You know Dona Sol Juan and I are old friends 
We ran away together with some other boys 
What happened We ate the horse 
You did 
How did it taste 
Excellent Ah those were good days 
We were great rivals even then 
Senora would you like to dance 
I'd love to 
It's mine 
Camarero a new glass 
What are you doing 
It's well to keep in practice 
What are you talking about 
Get up Get up Suppose someone should see you 
I don't like to see you on your knees like this 
What's wrong with my being on my knees 
That's how I pray and that's how I work 
This house was clean when we moved in 
Let it be clean when we move out 
Why must you always talk about moving out 
Because we've got to leave this house tomorrow 
Oh Oh Juan 
Will you listen to me now 
What do you want 
I want you to quit the bull ring 
Quit 
When I'm at the top 
I've been through all this before 
I know what to expect 
When you reach the top you begin to slip 
But you're wrong They all are 
Supposing we do have to move out of this house 
My hand 
His father was the same way 
Like father like son 
As for you you've probably never been baptized 
I'll baptize you now 
Father his face— 
Yes my son 
You were here 
I'm always here whenever you fight 
You mean all these weeks since you left me 
I never left you Juan 
Just a minute ago I was praying to see you 
I was thinking if you could love me again— 
You give me strength I can do anything 
It's the one I like best 
No you don't You hate it 
Like my mother does You hate them all 
I'm through with the ring forever 
You'll see They'll see everyone 
Carmencita will you wait for me here 
Yes Juanillo 
Ah Señor Toro we meet again 
Olé 
Ah that's our old Juan Magnificent 
Olé Olé Olé 
Olé 
Bravo 
The bull is not the beast 
Look at the crowd That is the real beast 
Now he's got it It's what you have wanted 
Now he's got it Now he's got it 
Carmen 
Oh it's— it's nothing 
I'll be up on my feet again before you know it 
Not a big place I wouldn't want a big place 
Just a little patch 
Somewhere in the country hmm 
And you—you'll teach me how to read and write 
Go to breakfast at— at some little inn 
Oh Juanillo dear does it hurt much 
Not a bit 
The bull hasn't been born yet that can— 
My child you must be brave as he was 
No Father I don't need courage 
I have his 
I'll always have it 
To me he'll never be dead

Wait a minute What were Kane's last words 
Do you remember boys 
What were the last words he said on Earth 
Maybe he told us about himself on his deathbed 
Maybe he didn't 
All we saw was a big American 
How did he differ from Ford Hearst or John Doe 
I tell you a man's dying words 
What were they 
You don't read the papers 
When Charles Foster Kane died he said one word: 
Rosebud 
That's all he said Tough guy

Send it right away 
I came to see you about this campaign of yours 
Do you know anything we can use against them 
You're still the college boy eh 
I remember 
See I do have a general idea of my holdings 
I sympathize with you 
Maybe somebody without money or property 
That would be too bad 
I saw your financial statement today 
Oh did you 
Yes 
I expect to lose $1 million next year 
With respect to the said newspapers 
the said Charles Foster Kane 
hereby relinquishes all control thereof 
and of the syndicates pertaining thereto 
and agrees to abandon all claim thereto 
Which means we're bust all right 
Well out of cash 
All right Mr Bernstein 
You're too old to call me Mr Thatcher Charles 
You're too old to be called anything else 
You were always too old 
My allowance 
measure of control Measure of control 
And we shall seek your advice 
This depression is temporary 
It's a cinch I'll die richer than I was born 
We never lost as much as we made 
Yes yes but your methods 
You always used money to 
To buy things

I always gagged on that silver spoon 
Don't you think you are 
What would you like to have been

Isn't it Jennings 
Yes ma'am 
Did you find what you were looking for 
What 
Who's a busy man me 
I'm chairman of the board 
I got nothing but time 
What do you want to know 
Maybe some girl 
There were a lot of them in the early days 
Well you're pretty young Mr Thompson 
You take me 
A white dress she had on 
She was carrying a white parasol 
I only saw her for one second 
Who else have you been to see 
Well I went down to Atlantic City 
Susie 
Thank you 
I called her myself the day after he died 
I thought maybe somebody ought to 
She couldn't even come to the phone 
I'll be seeing her again in a couple of days 
You were with him from the beginning 
From before the beginning young fellow 
And now it's after the end 
Have you tried to see anybody except Susie 
That man was the biggest fool I ever met 
He made an awful lot of money 
You take Mr Kane 
It wasn't money he wanted 
Thatcher never did figure him out 
Sometimes even I couldn't 
You know who you ought to see 
Mr Leland 
He was Mr Kane's closest friend 
They went to school together 
Harvard 
He was thrown out of a lot of colleges 
Mr Leland never had a nickel 
Take a good look at it Jedediah 
Jedediah

Ask them to sit down will you please 
The new publisher

Signed: 
Charles Foster Kane 
Can I have that Charlie 
I'm going to print it 
Solly 
Yes Mr Kane 
This morning's front page 
Yes 
Go down and tell them 
All right 
A document 
Sure 
This little pilgrimage will do us good 
Chronicle's a good idea for a newspaper 
Notice the circulation 
495 000 
With them it's no trick to get circulation 
You're right 
Twenty years 
Twenty years 
I felt like a kid in front of a candy store 
Welcome gentlemen to the Inquirer 
684 132 
I'm going abroad next week for a vacation 
I now realize I can't 
You can't blame me Mr Bernstein 
They've been making statues for 2 000 years 
And I've only been buying for five 
Promise me Mr Kane 
I promise Mr Bernstein 
Thank you 
Mr Bernstein 
And now gentlemen 
Your complete attention if you please 
Are we going to declare war on Spain 
Oh mama here they come 
Shoot me while I'm happy 
The Inquirer already has 
You long faced overdressed anarchist 
I'm not overdressed 
You are too 
Mr Bernstein look at his necktie 
Let's have the song about Charlie 
Is there a song about Charlie 
Is there a song about you Mr Kane 
I've seen that fellow 
He's good 
Good evening Mr Kane 
There is a man a certain man 
What is his name 
It's Charlie Kane it's Mister Kane 
Isn't it wonderful Such a party 
Yes 
What's the matter 
Oh mama please 
Give me that 
The blonde No the brunette 
Where did you learn that Charlie 
Sure they're just like anybody else 
They got work to do they do it 
Certainly not 
Without his knowing it 
Mr Leland I got a cable from Mr Kane 
I got a cable here from Mr Kane 
What 
From Paris France 
What 
From Paris France 
Come on in 
Why didn't you go to Europe with him 
He wanted you to 
Bernstein am I a stuffed shirt 
Am I a horse faced hypocrite 
Am I a New England schoolmarm 
Yes 
World's biggest diamond 
I didn't know Charlie was collecting diamonds 
He ain't 
Anyway he ain't only collecting statues 
Welcome home Mr Kane 
Welcome Mr Kane 
I know I've a moustache 
It looks awful 
Have we got a society editor 
Right here Mr Kane 
Miss Townsend is the society editor 
Miss Townsend this is Mr Charles Foster Kane 
I got a little social announcement 
I'm sorry I can't accept it now 
Goodbye 
Say he was in an awful hurry 
Hey everybody look out here 
Let's go to the window 
Mr Leland 
Mr Bernstein 
Yes Ms Townsend 
to Mr Charles Foster Kane 
Come on 
President's niece 
Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud 
It didn't end very well did it 
It ended 
Then there was Susie 
That ended too 
Yes 
Maybe that was something he lost 
You ought to see Jed Leland 
You take the Spanish American war 
I guess Mr Leland was right 
That was Mr Kane's war 
We didn't really have anything to fight about 
I wish I knew where Mr Leland was 
Maybe even he's dead 
You don't say 
Just old age 
I can remember absolutely everything young man 
That's my curse 
Not that Charlie was ever brutal 
He just did brutal things 
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge 
Do you happen to have a good cigar 
No I'm afraid I haven't 
Sorry 
I changed the subject didn't I 
What a disagreeable old man I have become 
I suppose he had some private sort of greatness 
But he kept it to himself 
He never gave himself away 
He never gave anything away 
He just left you a tip 
He had a generous mind 
I suppose he died without one 
That must have been pretty unpleasant 
But we do know what we're leaving 
We do believe in something 
Are you absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar 
Sorry Mr Leland 
Never mind 
I saw that in the Inquirer 
I never believed anything I saw in the Inquirer 
Anything else I can tell you about Emily 
I went to dancing school with Emily 
I was very graceful 
We were talking about the first Mrs Kane 
What was she like 
Very nice girl 
Emily was a little nicer 
It was a marriage just like any other marriage 
You're beautiful 
I can't be 
Yes you are 
You're very beautiful 
I've never been up this late 
It's a matter of habit 
What will the servants think 
That we enjoyed ourselves 
I absolutely adore you 
Charles even newspapermen have to sleep 
What time is it 
I don't know 
It's late 
It's early 
Charles 
It isn't just the time 
It's what you print attacking the President 
You mean Uncle John 
I mean the President of the United States 
I simply can't have it in the nursery 
Does he have to 
Yes 
Wasn't he ever in love with her 
He married for love 
Love 
That is why he did everything 
He wanted all the voters to love him too 
All he wanted out of life was love 
That's Charlie's story 
How he lost it 
You see he just didn't have any to give 
He loved Charlie Kane of course 
Very dearly 
And his mother I guess he always loved her 
How about his second wife 
Susan Alexander 
You know what Charlie called her 
What are you laughing at young lady 
What's the matter with you 
Toothache 
What 
Toothache 
Toothache 
You mean you've got a toothache 
What's funny about that 
You're funny mister 
You've got dirt on your face 
Not dirt it's mud 
Do you want some hot water 
I live right here 
What's that young lady 
All right thank you very much 
Do I look any better now 
This medicine doesn't do a bit of good 
What you need is to get your mind off it 
All right 
You have got a toothache haven't you 
I surely have 
Why don't you try laughing at me again 
What 
I'm still pretty funny 
I know but you don't want me to laugh at you 
I don't want your tooth to hurt either 
Look at me 
See that 
What are you doing 
I'm wiggling both my ears at the same time 
That's it smile 
That's it 
Is it a giraffe 
No not a giraffe 
I bet it is 
What 
Well then it's an elephant 
It's supposed to be a rooster 
A rooster 
No I'm not a magician 
I was just joking 
You really don't know who I am 
I guess you caught on to that 
I bet I've heard your name a million times 
I surely do 
You've been wonderful 
Without you I don't know what I would have done 
I had a toothache and I don't know many people 
I know too many people 
I guess we're both lonely 
I was just joking 
You see my mother died a long time ago 
Her things were put in storage out West 
There wasn't any other place to put them 
A sort of sentimental journey 
I run a couple of newspapers 
What do you do 
Me 
How old did you say you were 
I didn't say 
If you had I wouldn't have asked you 
How old 
Pretty old 
How old 
Twenty two in August 
That's a ripe old age 
What do you do 
Is that what you want to do 
No I wanted to be a singer I guess 
That is I didn't My mother did for me 
What happened to the singing 
Imagine 
Yes 
Have you got a piano 
A piano 
Yes there's one in the parlor 
Would you sing for me 
You wouldn't want to hear me sing 
Yes I would 
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you 
No that's all gone 
All right 
Now however I have something more than a hope 
Jim Gettys has something less than a chance 
Now I can afford to make some promises 
Mother is Pop governor yet 
Not yet Junior 
Gettys isn't even pretending 
Pop Hello son 
He isn't just scared he's sick 
Did you like your old man's speech 
I could hear every word 
Hello Emily 
Hold it 
Great speech Mr Kane 
Wonderful 
Will you get us a taxi 
I'm sending Junior home in the car with Oliver 
Good night Father 
Goodbye son 
Why did you send Junior home in the car 
What are you doing in a taxi 
There's a call I want you to make with me 
It can wait 
No it can't 
What's this all about Emily 
It may not be about anything at all 
I intend to find out Where are you going 
I'm going to 185 West 74th Street 
If you wish you may come with me 
I'll come with you 
Come right in Mr Kane 
Charlie 
He forced me to send your wife that letter 
I didn't want to 
He's been saying the most terrible 
Mrs Kane 
I don't suppose anybody would introduce us 
I'm Jim Gettys 
Yes 
She didn't want to at first 
But she did it 
Charlie the things he said to me 
He threatened to 
I won't wait until I'm elected 
To start with I think I'll break your neck 
Maybe you can do it and maybe you can't 
I'm Susan Alexander I know what you're thinking 
What does this note mean Ms Alexander 
She don't know 
Emily this gentleman I'm not a gentleman 
I don't even know what a gentleman is 
You see my idea of a gentleman 
He said unless you That's what I said 
What story 
The story about him and Ms Alexander 
There isn't any story 
Shut up 
Do you want me to give you the evidence 
So would you Mrs Kane 
What about me 
I'd say that it'd been made for you 
You can't tell me the voters of this state 
I am interested in our son 
Charlie if they publish this story They won't 
Good night Mr Gettys 
Are you coming Charles 
No 
I'm staying here 
I can fight this all alone 
Too late 
For what 
I've got nothing to say to you 
You're licked 
Only you're going to need more than one lesson 
And you'll get more than one lesson 
Don't worry about me 
I'm Charles Foster Kane 
I'm gonna send you to Sing Sing 
Have you a car Mrs Kane 
Yes thank you 
Good night 
Good night 
Paper 
Read all about it 
Paper 
No thanks 
This one 
That one 
Good night again 
You better go home and get some sleep 
You too 
Good night Mr Kane 
Hello Jedediah 
I'm drunk 
I'm not interested 
All right 
It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me 
As though they belong to you 
Jed You remember the workingman 
Go on home 
Oh boy 
I wouldn't worry about it too much 
You may not always be so lucky 
You're not very drunk 
Drunk what do you care 
You don't care about anything except you 
Only you want love on your own terms 
Let me work on the Chicago paper 
I am drunk 
I want to go to Chicago 
You're too valuable here 
Thank you 
I guess I'd better try to get drunk anyway

Are you singing at the Metropolitan 
We certainly are 
That won't be necessary 
No no no 
Places please 
And we've covered it from the news end 
And the social

What does it say there 
The notice what's he written

I knew I'd never get that through 
I guess that'll show you 
Hello Jedediah 
Hello Charlie 
I didn't know we were speaking 
Sure we're speaking Jedediah 
You're fired 
He was always trying to prove something 
That was trying to prove something 
He was going to take the quotes off the singer 
Hey nurse 
What's it called Shangri la 
What's the name 
All right Xanadu I knew it all the time 
You caught on didn't you 
I'm not that hard to see through 
Well I never even answered his letter 
Maybe I should have 
He hadn't finished it when she left him

I don't know 
Nurse

There's one thing you can do for me 
Sure 
Be glad to Thank you 
One is enough 
Well it was no truer then than it is today 
I'll take your arm 
All right 
You won't forget about those cigars 
I won't 
But I did an awful lot of singing after that 
I sang for teachers at $100 an hour 
The teachers got that I didn't 
What did you get 
He married you didn't he 
He was really interested in my voice 
Why did he build that opera house 
I didn't want it 
I didn't want a thing 
It was his idea 
Everything was his idea except my leaving him 
Don't forget 
Let's come back 
Look at me Mrs Kane darling 
You're out of pitch 
Some people can sing 
Some can't 
Impossible 
Please continue with the lesson 
But Mr Kane 
Please 
I'll be the laughingstock of the musical world 
People will think 
You're concerned what people will think 
Perhaps I can enlighten you a bit 
I'm an authority on what people will think 
The newspapers for example 
It's all right darling 
How can I persuade you You can't 
It's all right darling go ahead 
I thought you'd see it my way 
No no no 
Frappe 
Stop telling me he's your friend 
A friend don't write that kind of review 
I'll get it 
Friend 
And I never went to any swell schools 
That'll be enough Susan 
From Mr Leland sir 
Is that something from him 
Charlie 
What kind of firing do you call that 
Yes 
I sent him a check for $25 000 
What's that 
Declaration of Principles 
What 
What is it 
An antique 
You're awful funny aren't you 
I'm through 
I never wanted to do it in the first place 
You'll continue with your singing Susan 
I don't propose to have myself made ridiculous 
What about me 
I'm the one that has to sing 
I'm the one that gets the raspberries 
Why don't you leave me alone 
My reasons satisfy me Susan 
You seem unable to understand them 
I will not tell them to you again 
You'll continue with your singing 
Get Dr Corey 
Susan 
Yes I'm sure that was it 
No objections to my staying with her are there 
No not at all 
I'd like the nurse to be here too 
Good night Mr Kane 
Charlie 
I couldn't make you see how I felt Charlie 
That the whole audience doesn't want you 
That's when you got to fight them 
All right 
You won't have to fight them anymore 
It's their loss 
What are you doing 
Jigsaw puzzles 
Charlie what time is it 
11:30 
In New York 
I said what time is it in New York 
11 :30 
Night 
The Bulldog's just gone to press 
Well hurray for the Bulldog 
Gee 11:30 
Shows are just getting up 
People are going to nightclubs and restaurants 
You always said you wanted to live in a palace 
A person could go crazy in this dump 
Nobody to talk to nobody to have any fun with 
49 000 acres of nothing but scenery and statues 
I'm lonesome 
You make a joke out of everything 
Charlie I want to go to New York 
I'm tired of being a hostess 
I want to have fun Please Charlie 
Charlie please 
Our home is here Susan 
I don't care to visit New York 
What are you doing 
One thing I can never understand: 
How do you know you haven't done it before 
You may be right 
I sometimes wonder but you get into the habit 
It's not a habit I do it because I like it 
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow 
Invite everybody 
I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow 
You never give me anything I really care about 
You're in a tent darling you're not at home 
It's just money 
It doesn't mean anything 
I want you to stop this 
I'm not going to stop it 
You never gave me anything in your life 
Whatever I do I do because I love you 
You don't love me 
You want me to love you 
Sure I'm Charles Foster Kane 
Whatever you want just name it and it's yours 
But you gotta love me 
Don't tell me you're sorry 
I'm not sorry 
Mr Kane 
Mrs Kane would like to see you sir 
Marie has been packing for her since morning 
Tell Arnold I'm ready Marie 
Tell him he can get the bags 
Yes madame 
Have you gone completely crazy 
Packed your bag sent for the car 
And left you 
Of course they'll hear 
I'm not saying goodbye except to you 
But I never imagined people wouldn't know 
I won't let you go 
Goodbye Charlie 
Susan 
Please don't go 
Please Susan 
Not the way I think you want it but your way 
You mustn't go 
You can't do this to me 
I see 
It's you that this is being done to 
It's not me at all 
Not what it means to me 
I can't do this to you 
Oh yes I can 
The last 10 years have been difficult for many 
They haven't been tough on me 
I just lost all my money 
Monday with boys from the office 
Mr Rawlston wants the whole place photographed 
We run a picture magazine 
He's the butler 
You'll learn a lot from him 
He knows where all the bodies are buried 
Don't you think I do 
What do you know it's morning already 
Rosebud 
How much is it worth to you 
$1 000 
Well I'll tell you Mr Thompson 
He acted funny sometimes you know 
No I didn't 
Yes he did crazy things sometimes 
Rosebud 
Yes 
But I knew how to handle him 
Like that time his wife left 
Rosebud 
I see 
I heard him say it that other time too 
He just said: 
Rosebud 
Sentimental fellow aren't you 
Yes and no 
That isn't worth $1 000 
You can keep on asking questions if you want to 
Allow yourself plenty of time 
Better get going 
Can we come down 
Yes hurry up 
We're leaving 
Millions 
If anybody wants it 
What's that 
Another Venus 
$25 000 
A lot of money to pay for a dame without a head 
The banks are out of luck 
They'll clear all right 
He never threw anything away 
He sure liked to collect things 
Anything and everything 
A regular crow eh 
Hey look a jigsaw puzzle 
We got a lot of those 
Put all this stuff together: 
What would it spell 
Charles Foster Kane 
How about it Jerry 
That's what he said when he died 
Did you ever find out what it means 
No I didn't 
What did you find out about him 
Not much really 
We'd better get started 
What have you been doing all this time 
Playing with a jigsaw puzzle 
No I don't think so 
No 
It wouldn't have explained anything 
I don't think any word can explain a man's life 
No 
A missing piece 
Come on everybody we'll miss the train 
Throw that junk in 
Maybe I was what you nowadays call a stooge 
Everything was his idea except my leaving him 
I've got his trunk all packed 
I've had it packed for a week now 
You're gonna need more than one lesson 
And you'll get more than one lesson 
Who's a busy man me 
I'm chairman of the board 
I got nothing but time 
What do you want to know 
We thought 
Sentimental fellow aren't you 
Yes and no 
I think it would be fun to run a newspaper 
I think it would be fun to run a newspaper 
He'll get through 
Look out for Mr Stork that persevering chap 
He'll come along and drop a bundle in your lap 
You may be poor or rich It doesn't matter which 
Don't try to get away He'll find you in the end 
So you'd better look out for Mr Stork 
Look out for Mr Stork He's got you on his list 
And when he comes around it's useless to resist 
Maybe he's got his eye on you

How could she possibly get down here 
Please Oh all right Please

I imagine my father always wanted me to 
I just never cared for the brewing business 
Oh You say that's why you've never married 
Oh no It's just that I I've never met her 
I suppose she's around somewhere in the world 
Well 
I think so 
Oh no she isn't 
Oh how are her teeth 
Huh 
Oh now you're kidding me Not badly 
You have a right to have an ideal 
Oh I guess we all have one 
What does yours look like 
He's a little short guy with lots of money 
Why short 
What does it matter if he's rich 
Oh yes he won't do card tricks 
Oh he isn't That's why he's my ideal 
Why don't you marry one of them 
I want him to sort of take me by surprise 
Like a burglar 
That's right 
And then 
Oh Ohhh 
You better go to bed Hopsie 
I think I can sleep peacefully now 
I wish I could say the same 
I trust I see you full of sparkle Morning

His hands are clammy with excitement 
He won't know an ace from a deuce 
You weren't thinking of taking him 
What were you thinking of 
I don't think you understand either of you 
This is on the up and up 
He's Oh I don't know 
He's kind of touched something in my heart 
And I'd give a lot to be 
And I wish you all the happiness in the world 
Straight to where 
You know what I mean 
Playing cribbage with Gerald 
Tend to knitting 
I'll play cards 
Not with him 
I suppose you could take that back

I'll have to get off my horse to admire it 
And so will Charles the heel 
Stop that Must I 
Eve Yes Charles

Oh yes you You can't be too careful 
That's right 
I I feel I've known you always 
That's the way I feel about you 
That's right How did you guess

Oh but you do Charles 
Eve Charles

Hello darling I 
I thought I had a reason but now I 
Well I just wanted to tell you this 
I don't want any money; I don't want anything 
I think that's only fair 
There's only one thing I want 
I want to see him first and I 
I want him to ask me to be free 
That's all No money no nothing 
It's a trick Will you keep out of this 
Well that's all she wants When can you go 
Go ahead and talk I'm listening 
Hello Yes Horace

Where is he going 
No 
Thank you Horace

Don't you know you're the only man I ever loved 
Will you forgive me 
For what 
Oh you mean on the boat 
The question is can you forgive me

Positively the same dame 
Yes sweetheart 
A customer 
Shoo her in Effie darling Shoo her in 
Will you come in Miss Wonderly 
Thank you 
They mentioned yours 
I'm from New York 
I'm trying to find my sister 
I don't know where she met him 
They're coming home the first of the month 
You've had word of your sister 
A letter from her about two weeks ago 
It said nothing except that she was all right 
I sent her a telegram begging her to come home 
It's not always easy to know what to do 
You haven't found her No 
It was horrible waiting 
I sent her another letter to General Delivery 
Yesterday afternoon I went to the post office 
He wouldn't tell me where Corinne was 
He said she didn't want to see me 
I can't believe that 
Excuse me 
It's all right Miles Come in 
Miss Wonderly my partner Miles Archer 
They're here in San Francisco 
Right 
Yes 
well we have ways of managing that Yeah 
But you must be careful 
I'm deathly afraid of him of what he might do 
Mightn't he do something to her 
But I want you to know he's a dangerous man 
I honestly don't think he'd stop at anything 
Could he cover up by marrying her 
He has a wife and three children in England 
He has dark hair and thick bushy eyebrows 
What does he do for a living 
I haven't the faintest idea 
What time's he coming to see you 
After 8:00 
I'll look after it myself 
Thank you 
Oh yes 
Will that be enough 
Thank you Not at all 
Thank you 
Thank you so much Goodbye 
They're right enough 
They have brothers in her bag

Hotel people know anything about him 
Nothing except that he lived there a week 
Alone 
Yeah alone 
Did you find out who he was 
What his game was 
Well did you 
Well you know me Spade 
But that won't stop me from nailing you 
Fair enough 
Success to crime 
She's in there 
Sorry angel I didn't mean 
Hello Iva 
Sam

Goodbye Iva 
Well how did you and the widow make out

Hello 
Yeah this is Sam Spade 
Where 
What's the name 
Miss LeBlanc 
Okay I'll be right over 
Come in Mr Spade 
Sit down 
Mr Spade I 
I have a terrible terrible confession to make 
What is your name Wonderly or LeBlanc 
We believed your $200 
You mean that 
You warned us that Thursby was dangerous 
No I wouldn't say that you were at fault 
Thank you 
Mr Archer was so alive yesterday 
so solid and hearty and Stop it 
He knew what he was doing 
Those are the chances we take 
Was he married 
Please don't That's the way it was 
Mr Spade do they know about me 
Do they have to know about me 
Maybe but I gotta know what it's all about 
I can't tell you 
I can't tell you now 
I will later when I can 
You've got to trust me Mr Spade 
I'm so alone and afraid 
I've got nobody to help me if you won't help me 
Be generous Mr Spade 
You're brave You're strong 
Help me Mr Spade I need help so badly 
Help me 
I deserve that 
It's my own fault if you can't believe me now 
Now you are dangerous 
I met him in the Orient 
Betray you How 
Why did you want him shadowed 
Did he kill Archer 
Certainly 
Did you No 
That's good 
Why all the guns 
He lived by them 
You picked a nice sort of a playmate 
How bad a spot are you actually in 
Bad as could be 
Physical danger 
Then it's that 
It's that as surely as we're sitting here 
Unless you help me 
Who killed Thursby your enemies or his 
I don't know 
His I suppose 
I'm afraid I don't know 
You won't go to the police 
It's useless and hopeless I suppose 
How much money have you got 
I've got about $500 left 
Give it to me 
Well can't you get some more No 
There you are 
I'll ring four times long short long short 
Anything stirring 
Did you send the flowers 
Hello Sid 
Yeah What'll it cost to be on the safe side 
Well maybe it's worth it 
Okay go ahead 
Gardenia 
Quick darling in with him 
Will you come in Mr Cairo 
Will you sit down Mr Cairo 
Thank you sir 
Now what can I do for you Mr Cairo 
Thanks 
I beg your pardon No 
More than idle curiosity prompted my question 
I thought and hoped you could assist me 
No questions will be asked 
$5 000 is a lot of money 
Yes Effie 
Good night 
$5 000 is 
I intend to search your offices Mr Spade 
Go ahead and search 
Will you please come to the center of the room 
I have to make certain that you are not armed 
Look what you did to my shirt 
Sorry 
Mr Spade my offer is genuine 
Do you have it No 
Who is he 
No I do not think it would be better 
So will you to the extent of $5 000 
There's nothing like $5 000 here 
You want some assurance of my sincerity 
A retainer 
Would that do It might 
You will take say $100 
No I will take say $200 
What's your second guess 
If possible 
But in any case with discretion 
May I please have my gun now 
Oh sure I'd forgotten all about it 
I intend to search your offices 
Why sure 
Go ahead 
Turn to the right and go up the hill driver 
Mr Spade 
Do you bring any news 
Well they won't for a while anyway 
You are wonderful 
You won't get into any trouble will you 
I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble 
Do sit down 
Why I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean 
I haven't lived a good life I've been bad 
Worse than you could know 
I won't be innocent 
Good 
By the way I saw Joel Cairo tonight 
Do you know him 
Only slightly 
You're good You're very good 
What did he say 
About what 
About me Nothing 
What did you talk about then 
He offered me $5 000 for the black bird 
No I'm not 
What did you say 
I said $5 000 was a lot of money 
It is 
That's good coming from you 
What have you ever given me beside money 
What else is there I can buy you with 
Can't you trust me a little longer 
How much is a little 
What are you waiting for 
I've got to talk to Joel Cairo 
I can't let him know where I am I'm afraid 
My place then 
Hello 
That again 
Do you know that's true though 
But don't worry about that now 
He'll be along any minute 
Sure 
You are a godsend 
Well now don't overdo it 
Yeah I know I spotted him 
What What's that 
What boy 
Did he follow you to my apartment 
No I shook him long before that 
Come in Mr Cairo 
How soon can you have the money ready 
The money is ready 
In cash 
Yes 
That's probably true 
But I haven't got the Falcon 
Then where is it 
Where Floyd hid it 
Floyd hid 
And you know where he hid it 
Then why do we have to wait a week 
Perhaps not a whole week 
Because I'm afraid 
What exactly did happen to Floyd 
The fat man 
Fat man 
Is he here 
I don't know I suppose so 
What difference does it make 
It might make a world of difference 
What was his name 
You mean the one you couldn't get to come to 
When you're slapped you'll take it and like it 
Who's that 
I don't know Keep quiet 
Hello

Why don't you be reasonable 
Is there anything to it 
Not a thing 
Anything to that No

You dirty filthy liar You It isn't true 
And then she struck me with a pistol 
Why don't you make him tell the truth 
Behave yourself sister 
That's no way to act 
I'll bet 
That's a lie too 
That is Mr Joel Cairo 
Cairo was an acquaintance of Thursby's 
Then he pulled a gun on me 
You know how that is Lieutenant

That gun was a plant It was one of mine 
No Sam No Well then get him out of here 
Where do you live Get him out of here 
I've had enough 
Yeah I think I'll be going now 
What's the hurry Cairo 
Tell him to leave the gun 
I hope you know what you're doing Sam 
Do you always carry on so highhanded 
Well you've had your talk with Cairo 
Now you can talk to me 
Yes of course 
I'm listening 
I'm still listening 
Look at the time I must be going No 
Am I a prisoner 
Maybe the boy outside hasn't gone home yet 
Do you suppose he's still there 
Likely 
You can start now 
You are the most insistent person 
And wild and unpredictable huh 
I might 
Here 
What makes it so important 
I don't know They wouldn't tell me 
That was in Istanbul 
Marmara 
Go ahead 
But that's all 
So we did exactly that to him 
I'd learned that by the time we got here 
What's the bird made of 
You are a liar 
I am 
I've always been a liar 
Don't brag about it 
Was there any truth at all in that yarn 
Some 
Not very much 
Well we got all night 
I'm so tired 
So tired of lying and making up lies 
Not knowing what is a lie and what's the truth 
I want to talk to Mr Cairo Joel Cairo 
Thanks 
Where is he 
What 
Where is he 
Who 
Cairo 
I'll tell you when I am 
New York aren't you 
Shove off 
I told you to shove off 
Shove off 
People lose teeth talking like that 
You want to hang around you'll be polite 
Luke

I want to show you something 
What do you want here 
I won't forget you guys 
Say what about Miles 
I'll see you Luke 
Good morning 
Good morning There you are sir 
Let's go someplace where we can talk 
You mean last night 
What else could I do 
What do you want me to do Learn to stutter 
Dundy take you down to the station 
How long did they work on you 
Till a little while ago 
What'd they shake out of you 
Shake out 
Not one thing 
I felt distinctly like an idiot repeating it 
Don't worry about the story's goofiness 
You sure you didn't tell them anything 
I did not 
See you later 
No not yet 
That's the third time she's called this morning 
Anything else 
And a Mr Gutman called 
Gutman huh 
Thanks darling 
Darling Somebody's been in my apartment 
You must have let that boy follow you there 
You saw Joel this morning 
Yeah 
Why 
Now we've got to find a new home for you 
I won't go back there 
I got an idea Wait a minute 
That's what I mean 
You mean at home 
Yeah 
Is she in any danger Sam 
I think she is 
Gee that'd scare Mom into a green hemorrhage 
You're a darling 
Brigid 
That's very kind of you 
I'll give Mom a ring 
There's time enough for that when you get back 
I'll call you later 
Hello 
This is Samuel Spade 
Spade 
Hello honey 
Yeah 
2:30 All right 
Thanks 
Sam forgive me Please forgive me 
I sent those policemen to your place last night 
I was mad crazy with jealousy 
What made you think of that 
I was mad Sam I wanted to hurt you 
Did you tell them who you were when you phoned 
No 
Sam dearest I 
Where'd you phone from 
The drugstore across from your place 
Home 
I was 
Now you run along 
Hello 
Yeah this is Spade 
Well now 
The sooner the better Say 15 minutes 
Mr Spade 
How do you do Mr Gutman 
You begin well sir 
I distrust a man who says when 
You're a close mouthed man 
No I like to talk 
Now sir We'll talk if you like 
Swell 
Will we talk about the black bird 
You're a man for me sir 
No beating about the bush Right to the point 
Let's talk about the black bird by all means 
But first sir answer me a question 
It depends on 
Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo 
Maybe 
The question is then which you represent 
It'll be one or the other 
I didn't say so 
Who else is there 
There's me 
That's wonderful sir wonderful 
Don't we all 
I don't trust a man who says he's not 
Now let's talk about the black bird 
Let's 
No 
No not even if I thought so 
You mean you don't know what the bird is 
She didn't tell you what it is 
Cairo didn't either 
He offered me $10 000 for it 
$10 000 
Dollars mind you not even pounds 
Do they know what that bird is sir 
What is your impression 
Not an injudicious thing to do 
Well sir where is it 
It's hardly equitable sir 
Well think again and think fast 
What are you wasting my time for 
I can get along without you 
I'll kill him if you don't I'll kill him 
Think it over You've got till 5:00 
Then you're either in or out for keeps 
Who killed Thursby 
I don't know 
Why shouldn't you if you've nothing to conceal 
Everybody has something to conceal 
I'll see you at the inquest maybe 
Come on He wants to see you 
Now let's go 
Come in sir Thank you for coming Come in 
He might get himself hurt 
Well well what's this 
Sit down 
Let's talk about the black bird 
All right sir let's 
Let's 
Do you follow me 
I imagine they were pretty well fixed 
Well sir 
what do you think of that 
I don't know 
It never reached Spain 
In 1713 it turned up in Sicily 
In 1840 it appeared in Paris 
You begin to believe me a little 
I haven't said I didn't 
Charilaos re enameled the bird 
If I'd only known a few days sooner 
I was in London when I heard 
That was 17 years ago 
I wanted it 
He didn't know a thing about it 
So I sent him some agents to get it 
Well sir they got it and I haven't got it 
But I'm going to get it 
Your glass 
A couple of days That is satisfactory 
What's your idea of a fair bargain 
That would amount to a vastly greater sum 
How much greater 
Who knows Shall we say $100 000 
Why not 
What would you say to a quarter of a million 
In your own words why not 
That's a lot of dough A lot of dough 
Minimum huh 
What's the maximum 
The maximum I refuse to guess 
You'd think me crazy 
I don't know 
There's no telling how high it could go sir 
That is the one and only truth about it 
Wilmer 
Hello Effie It's me 
Isn't there 
What 
She didn't show up 
Yeah let's do something right for a change 
What insurance was she carrying 
Anybody burnt 
No 
Only the harbor watch was aboard 
Someone I know came 
Huh 
Now you know as much about it as I do precious 
The part about the bird is thrilling 
Or ridiculous 
You know 
Falcon 
Lock that door 
Is 
Is he 
Yeah 
Here here here none of that now 
You can't pass out on me now 
All right Sam 
Do you really think it's 
Answer the phone 
Hello 
Yes 
Who 
Oh yes 
Where 
Yes yes 
Hello Hello 
She's in danger 
Where is she 
Burlingame 26 Ancho 
Sam her voice it was awful 
You've got to go Sam 
All right I'll go 
Now after I've gone you phone the police 
Now get that straight 
Yes Sam 
Okay

Nope but if she's there we can find her 
Keep your motor running 
Bum steer Mr Spade 
Yeah 
Let's get to a phone booth 
Hello Mrs Perine Is Effie there 
Yes please 
Hello precious What's the good news 
Well it was hooey 
Everything go all right 
Nothing said about the bundle huh 
That's swell 
They take you down to the hall 
All right precious 
I've been hiding in a doorway up the street 
I thought you'd never come 
Can you make it all right or shall I carry you 
Well sir we're all here 
Sure 
Never mind Wilmer 
You certainly are a most headstrong individual 
Well let's be seated 
Well sir as to that 
As to that 
$10 000 
With a dollar of this you can buy $10 of talk 
That may be but I've got the Falcon 
There's something else to be discussed first 
We've got to have a fall guy 
Three 
The point is we've got to give the police 
or that you're not quite able to handle 
I'm in this up to my neck Gutman 
Let's give them the gunsel 
Let's give him to them 
By gad sir you are a character That you are 
Really I do 
Let him talk his head off 
Well what do you think of this Wilmer 
Mighty funny Mighty funny 
How do you feel now 
Any better precious 
Much better 
But I'm frightened 
You want a drink angel 
Be careful Sam 
Well 
Get up on your feet 
Get up and shoot it out 
Young Wild West 
Now now Wilmer We can't have any of that 
Then tell him to lay off me then 
Now Wilmer 
All right I've got another suggestion 
You want to hear it 
Most assuredly 
Give them Cairo 
Well by gad sir 
You want the Falcon I've got it 
The fall guy's part of the price I'm asking 
Now come gentlemen 
Let's keep our discussion on a friendly basis 
If you kill me how are you gonna get the bird 
Yes that's 
That's true 
You see what I mean 
By gad sir you are a character 
Six two uneven They're selling you out sonny 
Wilmer here is All right 
Wilmer 
There's our fall guy 
Don't like that sir 
You won't like it Well 
You can have him 
Excellent sir excellent 
Now let's get the details fixed first 
I shall be candid with you sir 
Thursby was Miss O'Shaughnessy's ally 
We did Yes sir We most certainly did 
That sounds all right 
Now Jacoby 
Tell me what happened 
Mr Cairo is a man of nice judgment 
The Paloma was his thought 
There was no place for you in our plan sir 
Well sir we mere men should have known better 
It was neatly done sir Indeed it was 
You touched off the boat before you left 
No not intentionally 
No doubt he was careless with matches 
How about the shooting 
There's only one Maltese Falcon 
How about some coffee 
Put the pot on will you angel 
I don't like to leave our guests 
Surely 
I want to know about this 
You palmed it 
I palmed it Yes 
By gad I believe you would I really do 
You palmed it 
Yes sir that I did 
I must have my little joke now and then 
I ought to have more than $10 000 
Oh yes 
$10 000 is all the money I can raise 
But you didn't say positively 
Positively 
I'd like to give you a word of advice 
Go ahead 
Dangerous 
Very 
How's the coffee coming angel 
In a few minutes 
It's almost daylight Mr Spade 
Can you start getting it now 
I guess so 
Hello 
Now listen carefully Here's the plot 
That's a good girl Now hustle Goodbye 
Thanks lady Sorry to spoil your day of rest 
Not the first one you've spoiled Anything else 
No No thanks 
Bye bye then 
There you are 
Now after 17 years 
It is it 
But we'll make sure 
Fake 
It's a phony It's lead 
It's lead 
It's a fake 
No Sam No 
That's the one I got from Kemidov I swear it 
You 
It's you who bungled it 
You and your stupid attempt to buy it 
Kemidov found out how valuable it was 
No wonder we had such an easy time stealing it 
You imbecile 
You bloated idiot 
You stupid fathead you 
Well sir what do you suggest 
Are you going 
I'm going with you 
Wilmer 
A swell lot of thieves 
In short sir I must ask you for my $10 000 
This'll take care of my time and expenses 
You don't 
Well frankly sir I'd like to have you along 
I'll make out all right 
Hello Is Sergeant Polhaus there 
Yeah Put him on This is Sam Spade 
Hello Tom 
He's working for a man named Kasper Gutman 
That fellow Cairo's in with him too 
They just left here for the Alexandria Hotel 
Yes that's right Very 
Now good luck Tom 
That's a lie 
You told Thursby he was being followed 
I told him 
I told him 
Yes but please believe me Sam 
But he'd have gone up there with you angel 
He was just dumb enough for that 
Don't Sam Don't say that Stop it 
Why do you accuse me 
Now why did you shoot Miles 
I didn't mean to at first really I didn't 
I can't look at you and tell you this Sam 
If Thursby was killed you were rid of him 
Isn't that right 
Something like that 
Yes Sweetheart it wasn't only that 
I'd have come back to you sooner or later 
From the very first instant I saw you I knew 
You're not 
Yes angel I'm gonna send you over 
The chances are you'll get off with life 
I'll be waiting for you 
If they hang you I'll always remember you 
Don't Sam 
Don't say that even in fun 
You do such wild and unpredictable things 
Now don't be silly 
You're taking the fall 
You didn't care at all 
You don't love me 
I won't play the sap for you 
You know it's not like that You can't say that 
You killed Miles and you're going over for it 
How can you do this to me Sam 
Surely Mr Archer wasn't as much to you as 
Listen 
This won't do any good 
Wait till I'm through Then you can talk 
Since I've got something on you 
All those are on one side 
But look at the number of them 
And what have we got on the other side 
You know whether you love me or not 
Come in 
Hello Tom Got them 
Got them 
What's the matter with your little playmate 
He looks brokenhearted 
Cut it out Sam 
Well shall we be getting down to the hall 
It's heavy 
What is it 
The stuff that dreams are made of 
I beg your pardon Was that your leg

Are you always frank with them like this 
No not particularly 
No it isn't that 
Where are we going 
I don't know anywhere 
That's why I stayed away from you for a week

So did I 
I pictured it all rather conventionally 
No 
Get out 
Why have you stopped 
I'm sure I don't know 
Come on 
Good evening Burton 
I saw you coming up the drive miss 
Very good 
Shall we go in the study

I know what I want 
Are you courting me 
I'm afraid I am 
This is a wonderful moment 
Do you like this room

It isn't bad news is it dear 
You couldn't spare £1 000 could you 
What does he want it for 
You borrowed it Why 
Didn't you have any money of your own 
Not a shilling 
But I thought 
I had the impression 
I'll take care of old Henry somehow 
I still don't understand 
Are you broke 
Why didn't you tell me 
Every time I brought the subject up you 
Whatever made you take this extravagant house 
I didn't think you'd want to live in a shack 
Were you thinking of my inheritance when 
I don't know what to say 
Now darling really 
Why not be comfortable now 
Johnnie 
I'm just beginning to understand you 
You're a baby 
What about your father 
Of course not darling 
Well then 
Answer me Johnnie 
I suppose I'll have to 
I think you must be mad

Here dear Come on

He sent us both of them 
These are Father's most precious possessions 
You don't say 
and then to their children 
That's the thing to do with them all right 
What was that 
Yes you've made me very happy

One of these days it will kill him 
Hello Mrs Aysgarth 
How are you Mrs Newsham 
I'm afraid not They're for Johnnie 
Since when has he 
Detective stories 
And it seems to agree with him 
Abandoned all his vices has he 
Vices What vices Mrs Newsham 
Such as betting at the races for instance 
He has no time for that 
He's much too busy with his job 
He was at the Merchester Races 
Was he How interesting Good afternoon 
Goodbye 
Good afternoon Mrs Aysgarth 
Good afternoon Is Mr Aysgarth in 
Why no 
When do you expect him 
I really couldn't say 
Perhaps you'd like to talk to Captain Melbeck 
Yes I would very much please 
Mrs Aysgarth to see you 
Come in 
What a pleasure to see you Good afternoon 
Do sit down 
Thank you 
Yes I can understand that 
I don't understand 
I told him I wouldn't prosecute 
What on earth are you talking about 
How does he get away with it 
When did you discharge him 
I haven't a very keen sense of humor 
If this is a joke I wish you would tell me 
It's not funny to me 
We had an unexpected audit six weeks ago 
The accounts showed a deficit of £2 000 
And when I looked into Johnnie's records 
I'm terribly sorry 
He should have told you 
It's perfectly all right 
And you say you aren't going to prosecute 
Not for the time being 
Yes of course Thank you very much 
Goodbye 
Good afternoon madam 
Mr Aysgarth home yet No madam 
Then you've heard 
Yes I've heard 
I'm so sorry darling I'm terribly sorry 
And to my dear sister Emily Scudamore 
I could do with a drink 
You win old boy 
Yes dear 
Why do you ask that 
So that's what you meant 
You haven't answered my question 
What about you 
Have you any regrets 
Do you really mean that 
Yes I really mean that 
And if you were to die first I 
If I were to die first 
Listen what about you 
I couldn't stop loving you if I tried 
Have you tried 
Yes 
When 
How long have you known 
Since last Friday 
Who told you 
Captain Melbeck 
Did he tell you why 
Suppose you tell me why 
We just didn't get along 
Why didn't you get along with him 
I don't know 
You think I'm talking through my hat don't you 
Look at this all land for instance 
If I had £10 000 or better still £20 000 
I could start a development here 
All you need is £20 000 
Or £30 000 
An extra £10 000 wouldn't hurt a bit 
Beaky this is the ground plan 
Wonderful We could put the large hotel there 
Beechnuts old bean 
Huts Beaky Hello 
What a view what sun what air 
Then we're going to sell part of it at a profit 
Yes but it will need financing won't it 
Of course 
You found somebody to put up the money 
Of course 
Who 
I see 
The company's going to be in my name 
Yes but 
Perfectly 
I think 
Thank you 
All right old bean 
Please explain it to me will you 
We buy up this land and then we sell part of it 
That gives us a 100% profit in no time 
On the other part we build something or other 
But from whom do you buy the land 
That shouldn't be difficult 
Isn't it about time you grew up 
You're scolding me 
You need a scolding 
Do I 
You're not being fair to Johnnie 
Gets a salary writes his own checks 
Is that it 
Hadn't you better change for dinner 
You know your room 
I shan't be a jiffy 
I wasn't really 
I was only You were only what 
What do you know about business 
Very little 
I was only 
But if it weren't any good 
That's my business not yours 
If I say it's good it's good 
I'm going through with this deal 
Is that clear Yes that's clear 
You frightened me I didn't see you coming 
Why What happened 
Nothing 
No not yet 
Why are you doing it 
I don't know Perhaps the land isn't any good 
Or perhaps it's a stiff job and I'm too lazy 
Are you still angry about last night 
No I'm not angry 
Are you sure 
Because I couldn't sleep all night 
Afraid of what 
I was afraid you'd stopped loving me 
And I love you very much 
D O U B 
There's no such word 
Take that old girl 
Do I get another turn 
without first proving to you it's no good 
If you say it's no good that satisfies me 
Why are you so insistent 
Because as I told you I won't be responsible 
What time do we have to start 
The earlier the better I'd say about 7:00 
There won't be so much traffic then 7:00 
That's a bit pig's tail 
Pig's tail Too early 
Did you never hear that one pig's tail 
Is Mr Aysgarth having breakfast 
Mr Thwaite's I believe 
This ought to do it Put in the plug now 
How's that old bean 
Hello old girl Hello darling 
What's all this 
I've only been away a few hours 
It seemed like a thousand years 
Seems like that to me too Shut up Beaky 
It was nothing Nothing 
I came very close to losing my life 
You call that nothing 
Let's drop the subject 
No Beaky go on I want to hear 
There was too much chalk in the soil 
Was Johnnie in the car No 
He was a few feet away looking over at the view 
I should be in kingdom come by now 
Johnnie saved your life 
He certainly did 
Came jolly close to losing his own too 
I can never tell you how much this means to me 
To you darling 
It means a good bit to me too 
A spot of celebrating on me 
Yes 
My securities are over there 
Why don't you come over with me 
The cad seems to forget I'm a married man 
I'll tell you what I might do 
Lina 
Do let him come 
It seems to me that Yes I know 
It seems to you I should be looking for a job 
Yes of course he would Do let him come Lina 
I don't see very well how I can stop him 
Great 
Pity that he won't come to Paris with me 
Sorry old girl 
Nearly put the foot in it again have I 
There's an Inspector Hodgson in the hall ma'am 
He wanted to see Mr Aysgarth 
Show him to the study will you Ethel please 
Very good madam 
Mrs Aysgarth Yes 
My name's Hodgson 
Inspector Hodgson We're from the county police 
This is my colleague Mr Benson 
How do you do Mr Benson How do you do 
Won't you sit down 
Thank you ma'am 
I understand your husband's not in 
He's been up in London for two days 
Won't you have some tea or something 
No thank you We've had ours 
I believe you know a Mr Thwaite 
Yes he's a close friend of my husband 
I don't know how to put it quite 
Perhaps it would be easier if I showed you this 
This afternoon's paper 
Excuse me 
I'm sorry This is a shock 
We knew him so very well 
Both men had evidently been drinking 
On arrival Thwaite ordered a bottle of brandy 
having left the place a few minutes before 
I'm sorry to upset you ma'am 
Yes I believe I can 
Any further questions Benson 
None that I can think of 
I'm sorry 
When does Mr Aysgarth return from London 
I expect him this evening 
Would you ask him to ring me at the station 
Yes of course Goodbye Inspector Hodgson 
Goodbye Benson 
Goodbye Mrs Aysgarth 
He didn't go to Paris 
He didn't go to Paris I tell you 
Hogarth Club 
May I speak to Mr Aysgarth please 
When do you expect him 
He left yesterday morning 
It doesn't matter Thank you 
I was terribly fond of Beaky 
Were you 
Yes dear 
I loved that silly generous good hearted fool 
Did you Of course I did 
Next to me 
Poor Monkeyface 
You liked him too didn't you 
I liked him very much 
The police were here 
What did they want 
They wanted you to help them 
What else 
The inspector wants you to phone him 
What did you tell them 
Did you mention the corporation 
Naturally 
That's about all 
Hello Wickstead police station please 
Hello Inspector 
This is John Aysgarth I've just got home Yes 
We dined at the Savoy 
No 
Yes 
Then I saw him off at Croyden Airport 
Yes No 
Yes 
Yes 
Not at all Inspector 
Isobel may I come in 
How sweet of you 
Yes I have 
Thank you 
I never knew you were such a murder story fan 
Neither did I until recently 
Did you really like it 
I couldn't put it down 
My villain 
My hero you mean 
I always think of my murderers as my heroes 
It is murder 
I suppose it is 
What does Johnnie think 
Johnnie 
I haven't discussed it with him yet 
I should think he'd be interested 
That brandy business is just like my footbridge 
Was it murder or an accident 
The brandy thing isn't new at all you know 
It's been done before 
Yes and in real life too 
I have it here 
A man called Abbey 
Was he hanged 
Trial of Richard Palmer Where can it be 
He was a fool wasn't he 
If he'd stuck to brandy he might have 
That's an interesting idea 
Suppose I ask my brother about it 
I get some of my neatest ideas from him 
I'll run along I don't want to trouble you 
Now I remember It's in your own house 
What is 
Johnnie borrowed it a couple of weeks ago 
Goodbye Isobel Goodbye my dear 
Hello No he isn't in 
This is Mrs Aysgarth speaking 
This is the Guarantors Assurance Company 
Yes I will Thank you 
Good morning madam 
Good morning Are there any letters 
Hello Ethel You here again 
Hello darling Any letters for me 
Three 
Thank you dear 
Well well well 
Good news 
What a life 
That'd be a dream Poor old Spotty 
Darling you're not shivering are you 
I've a bit of a chill 
Cold in all this sunshine Let me warm you up 
My poor little shivering baby 
Better 
Much Good 
Perhaps this will help 
Darling what are we doing tonight 
We're going to Isobel's to dine 
What a bore 
Issie let's get back to that new book of yours 
Was he ashamed of his playing 
I arranged it this way 
I don't care much for that 
You're slipping old girl 
What's wrong with it my dear chap 
That's too complicated 
If you're going to kill somebody do it simply 
Am I right Dr Sedbusk 
You're right 
Just as long as you don't get caught 
Do the wine will you Yes Issie 
How would you do it simply 
For instance 
For instance poison 
Yes but did you get the murderer 
Let me see 
No I don't think we did 
There you are 
Think of it 
Thousands 
I don't know dear 
I don't see why they shouldn't be 
Fear of discovery my lad 
What about it Doctor 
Do let's hear about it No please 
Don't change the subject 
Nonsense No such thing 
I'll bet you know Doctor What is it 
Not in a million years 
Now come After all do I look like a murderer 
Can't you Issie 
What about me dear 
Could I murder anyone 
What about Mrs Aysgarth 
She has a strange glint in her eye 
Trying to look mysterious are you 
You can't fool me 
No I don't believe I could 
Johnnie you're locking up What about Ethel 
It's Ethel's day off 
She won't be back until morning 
What about Cook 
What's the matter dear 
Have you forgotten 
Cook's away on a holiday 
Yes I think that's what it must be 
Take off your coat 
No Johnnie Please don't 
Do you remember 
I shall never forget it 
Would you mind sleeping in your dressing room 
Of course I'd mind 
I understand 
Feeling better 
Yes thank you 
Hello Isobel 
How are you my dear 
All right 
I've been asleep all day haven't I 
Your nerves seemed to be all upset 
We were quite worried about you 
He says all you needed was a little sleep 
He's one in a million that Johnnie of yours 
Isn't he 
Do you mind if I smoke 
Have you been here all afternoon 
Naturally Ever since Johnnie phoned 
I warn you You'd better get well 
He flirted with you I suppose 
Flirted 
Worse than that 
He's worming all my secrets out of me 
He's always pestering me 
I always swear I won't tell him and I always do 
Did you tell him anything today 
Did I 
Never 
It was about that poison wasn't it 
I suppose I'll deserve it 
Imagine A substance in daily use everywhere 
Anyone can lay his hands on it 
Mind you it's undetectable after death 
Is whatever it is painful 
Not in the least 
Good night Lina 
You're still annoyed with me aren't you 
No Johnnie really I still don't feel well 
It's not exactly that Don't you understand 
Mother telephoned me and 
All right I'll run down and get the car ready 
No I'll drive myself 
I prefer to drive you 
I think I'll take the short cut 
Johnnie 
Johnnie 
Lina what's got into you 
Lina Stop it you little fool 
You almost killed us both back there 
You don't have to put up with me anymore 
Johnnie where are you going 
First I'm taking you to your mother's 
And then what 
Don't worry I won't bother you again 
Johnnie you mean you're going to 
What were you planning to do with it 
Johnnie you were going to kill yourself 
My darling 
Yes but I saw that was a cheap way out 
Prison 
I can't pay it back 
Paris 
I went to Liverpool 
Then you didn't go to Paris 
Of course not 
You were ashamed to come to me 
If I'd only understood 
It will work I know it will Johnnie please 
This isn't your problem Lina 
But it is You can't shut me out 
No Lina 
My darling 
Life may be swift and fleeting 
Hope may die Yet love's beautiful music 
Comes each day like the dawn 
Love is a song that never ends 
One simple theme repeating 
Like the voice of a heavenly choir 
Love's sweet music flows on 
Like the voice of a heavenly choir 
Love's sweet music flows on

Hello Bambi 
Remember me 
Thumper 
Right 
Hi fellas 
Flower 
Yeah 
Well what's the matter with them 
Why are they acting that way 
Why don't you know 
Your head's in a whirl 
And then you feel light as a feather 
And before you know it you're walking on air 
And then you know what 
You're knocked for a loop 
And you completely lose your head 
Gosh that's awful 
Gee whiz 
Terrible 
And that ain't all 
It can happen to anybody 
So you'd better be careful 
It could happen to you and you and 
Yes it could even happen to you

Me neither 
Me neither 
Hello Bambi 
Don't you remember me 
I'm Faline 
Bambi 
I bring you a song 
And I sing as I go 
For I want you to know 
That I'm looking for romance 
I bring you a song 
In the hope that you'll see 
When you're looking at me 
That I'm looking for love 
I'm seeking that glow 
Only found when you're young and it's May 
Only found on that wonderful day 
When all longing is through 
I'm seeking that glow 
Only found when a thrill is complete 
Only found when two hearts gently beat 
I bring you a song 
For I'm seeking romance 
You're by my side There's a moon up above 
I bring you a song 
For I'm seeking romance 
And you 
It is Man 
He is here again 
There are many this time 
We must go deep into the forest 
Hurry Follow me

It's Leech 
I knew it the minute I sighted the topmast 
The Black Swan And the Hawk I make it 
They've sighted us all right 
We can't outrun the Black Swan 
We'd be pounded to splinters in a fight 
We can't fight with 100 guns against us 
We can't fight and we can't run 
Run up the black flag and head her around 
Hoist the Jolly Roger 
It's a beggar's chance but our only one 
We'll join Leech and lead him to Maracaibo 
He's not an easy man to lead Jamie 
Main braces 
Back your main yards 
Come on Get back to your cabin and stay there 
Why

Don't tempt him darling I might take it 
That's teaching her Jamie 
No my sweet Now don't be a snob 
We're pulling close to Maracaibo Leech

Of all the nerve 
You dare not keep me out 
Yes What's the trouble

Hello Rick 
Your cash is good at the bar 
What 
Do you know who I am 
I do 
You're lucky the bar is open to you

Nothing 
But when you first came I thought 
You thought what 
What right do I have to think 
May I 
They got a lucky break 
I forgive you 
Will you have a drink with me 
You despise me don't you 
If I gave you any thought I probably would 
But why 
Do you object to the kind of business I do 
That's not so bad 
I get it for them for half 
Is that so parasitic 
And I'm leaving finally this Casablanca 
Myself 
I found myself much more reasonable 
Look Rick 
Know what this is 
Something that even you have never seen 
Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle 
Cannot be rescinded Not even questioned 
One moment 
Will you keep these for me please 
For how long 
Perhaps an hour Perhaps a little longer 
I don't want them here overnight 
Don't be afraid of that 
Please keep them for me 
Thank you 
I knew I could trust you 
I'll be expecting some people 
If anybody asks for me I'll be right here 
Rick I hope you're more impressed with me now 
Just a moment 
I've heard that rumor too 
Poor devils 
You're right Ugarte 
I am a little more impressed with you 
Say who's got trouble We got trouble

Did you abscond with the church funds 
Did you run off with a senator's wife 
I like to think you killed a man 
It's the romantic in me 
It's a combination of all three 
My health I came to Casablanca for the waters 
The waters What waters 
We're in the desert 
I was misinformed 
Excuse me Monsieur Rick 
I'll get it from the safe 
I'm so upset Rick You know I 
Forget it Emil 
Mistakes like that happen all the time 
I'm awfully sorry 
An arrest in your café 
Again 
This is no ordinary arrest 
A murderer no less 
I stick my neck out for nobody 
A wise foreign policy 
Out of my regard for you we're staging it here 
It will amuse your customers 
Our entertainment's enough 
We're to have an important guest here tonight 
Major Strasser of the Third Reich no less 
I see 
And what's Strasser doing here 
Perhaps not 
Here 
It shall not happen again 
That's all right 
How observant you are 
Yeah 
Have a brandy 
Thank you 
That is the reason we permit you to remain open 
That is another reason 
What's his name 
Victor Laszlo 
Victor Laszlo 
He's succeeded in impressing half the world 
It'll be interesting to see how he manages 
Manages what 
His escape 
But I just told you 
Stop it 
This is the end of the chase 
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't 
Is that a serious offer 
I just paid out 20 and I'd like to get it back 
Make it 10 
I'm only a poor corrupt official 
Okay 
Done 
Why two He is traveling with a lady 
He'll take one 
I think not 
I've seen the lady 
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are 
It doesn't matter 
There is no exit visa for him 
Let me point out just two items: 
In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia 
And got well paid for it on both occasions 
Maybe 
It seems you're determined to keep Laszlo here 
I have my orders 
I see Gestapo spank 
In Casablanca I am master of my fate 
I am 
Major Strasser is here sir 
You were saying 
Excuse me 
Take him quietly 
Two guards at every door Yes sir 
Everything is ready sir 
Go ahead 
Good evening gentlemen 
Good evening captain 
Won't you join us 
Thank you 
It's a pleasure to have you here major 
Champagne and a tin of caviar 
Thank you 
Very well sir 
A very interesting club 
Especially so tonight major 
I expected no less captain 
Monsieur Ugarte 
Will you please come with us Certainly 
May I first please cash my chips 
Very lucky huh 
Two thousand please 
Thank you 
Rick help me 
Don't be a fool You can't get away 
But Rick hide me Do something 
Excellent captain 
I stick my neck out for nobody 
Okay boss 
How do you do Mr Rick 
How do you do 
You already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich 
Please join us Mr Rick 
We are very honored tonight 
Well personally major I will take what comes 
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions 
Unofficially of course 
Make it official if you like 
What is your nationality 
I'm a drunkard 
And that makes Rick a citizen of the world 
There seems to be no secret about that 
It's not particularly my beloved Paris 
Can you imagine us in London 
When you get there ask me 
Diplomatist 
How about New York 
Who do you think will win the war 
I haven't the slightest idea 
Rick is completely neutral about everything 
And that takes in the field of women too 
You were not always so carefully neutral 
We have a complete dossier on you 
The reason is a little vague 
We also know what you did in Paris 
And also we know why you left Paris 
Don't worry we're not going to broadcast it 
Are my eyes really brown 
You will forgive my curiosity Mr Blaine 
In this case you have no sympathy for the fox 
Not particularly 
I understand the point of view of the hound too 
Of course one must admit he has great courage 
I admit he's clever 
Three times he slipped through our fingers 
In Paris he continued his activities 
We intend not to let it happen again 
Excuse me gentlemen 
Good evening Mr Blaine 
Perhaps 
Yes monsieur 
I reserved a table Victor Laszlo 
Yes Monsieur Laszlo Right this way 
I saw no one of Ugarte's description 
Victor I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here 
You'll find a market there for this ring 
I'm forced to sell it at a great sacrifice 
Thank you but I hardly think 
Perhaps for the lady 
The ring is quite unique 
Yes I'm very interested 
What is your name 
Berger Norwegian At your service sir 
I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar 
Such a bargain 
But that is your decision 
I'm sorry it is 
Monsieur Laszlo is it not 
Yes 
I am Captain Renault prefect of police 
Yes what is it you want 
Thank you 
I hope you'll forgive me captain 
May I present Miss Ilsa Lund 
That was a gross understatement 
You're very kind 
Won't you join us 
If you will permit me 
Captain please It's a game we play 
Captain the boy who's playing the piano 
Somewhere I've seen him 
Sam 
Yes 
He came from Paris with Rick 
Rick Who is he 
Mademoiselle you are in Rick's Rick is 
Is what 
Excuse me 
Major 
How do you do 
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to 
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I'm not gracious 
You see Major Strasser I am a Czechoslovakian 
You were a Czechoslovakian 
Now you are a subject of the German Reich 
I have never accepted that privilege 
And I'm now on French soil 
This is hardly the time or place 
Then we shall state another time and place 
Tomorrow at 10 in the prefect's office 
With mademoiselle 
Captain I am under your authority 
Is it your order that we come to your office 
Let us say it is my request 
That is a much more pleasant word 
Very well Mademoiselle 
A very clever tactical retreat major 
This time they really mean to stop me 
Victor I'm afraid for you 
I must find out what Berger knows 
Be careful 
I will Don't worry 
Monsieur Champagne cocktail please 
As you see it was true every single time 
Thank heaven I found you Berger 
He's supposed to help me 
Ugarte cannot even help himself 
He's under arrest for murder 
He was arrested here tonight 
I see 
Underground like everywhere else 
If you will come 
Will you ask the piano player to come over here 
Very well mademoiselle 
How's the jewelry business Berger 
Not so good Check please 
Too bad you weren't here earlier 
Yes 
My bill 
No 
Two champagne cocktails 
Please 
Hello Sam 
Hello Miss Ilsa 
I never expected to see you again 
It's been a long time 
Yes ma'am 
A lot of water under the bridge 
Some of the old songs Sam 
Yes ma'am 
Where is Rick 
I don't know 
I ain't seen him all night 
When will he be back 
Not tonight no more He ain't coming 
He went home 
Does he always leave so early 
Oh he never 
Well he's got a girl up to the Blue Parrot 
Goes up there all the time 
You used to be a much better liar Sam 
Leave him alone Miss Ilsa 
You're bad luck to him 
Play it once Sam For old times' sake 
I don't know what you mean Miss Ilsa 
Play it Sam 
Play As Time Goes By 
I'll hum it for you 
Sing it Sam 
You must remember this 
A kiss is just a kiss 
A sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by 
And when two lovers woo 
They still say I love you 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by 
Sam I thought I told you never to play 
May I present 
Hello Ilsa 
Hello Rick 
Then perhaps you also 
This is Mr Laszlo 
How do you do 
How do you do 
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca 
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere 
Won't you join us for a drink 
Rick never 
Thanks I will 
Well a precedent is being broken 
Interesting café 
I congratulate you 
I congratulate you 
What for 
Your work 
Thank you 
I try 
We all try You succeed 
I wasn't sure you were the same 
Let's see the last time we met 
Was La Belle Aurore 
How nice 
You remembered 
Not an easy day to forget 
I remember every detail 
The Germans wore gray you wore blue 
Yes I put that dress away 
When the Germans march out I'll wear it again 
Ricky you're becoming quite human 
I suppose we have to thank you for that 
So it is We have a curfew in Casablanca 
Your check sir 
It's my party 
Another precedent gone 
This has been a very interesting evening 
I'll call you a cab 
Gasoline rationing time of night 
We'll come again 
Anytime 
Say good night to Sam for me 
I will 
He hasn't played it in a long time 
Good night 
Good night 
A very puzzling fellow this Rick 
What sort is he 
Good night 
Boss 
Boss Yeah 
Boss ain't you going to bed 
Not right now 
You ever going to bed 
No 
Well I ain't sleepy either 
Good then have a drink 
Not me boss 
Then don't have a drink 
Boss let's get out of here 
No sir 
I'm waiting for a lady 
Please let's go 
Ain't nothing but trouble for you here 
She's coming back I know she's coming back 
We'll take the car and drive all night 
Shut up and go home will you 
No sir I'm staying right here 
They grab Ugarte then she walks in 
Well that's the way it goes One in one out 
Sam 
Yes boss 
What 
My watch stopped 
I bet they're asleep in New York 
I bet they're asleep all over America 
What's that you're playing 
A little something of my own 
Stop it 
You know what I want to hear 
No I don't 
You played it for her You can play it for me 
I don't think I can remember 
If she can stand it I can 
Play it 
Yes boss 
Who are you really 
And what were you before 
What did you do and what did you think 
We said no questions 
Here's looking at you kid 
A franc for your thoughts 
In America they'd bring only a penny 
I guess that's about all they're worth 
I'm willing to be overcharged 
Tell me 
Well I was wondering 
Why I'm so lucky 
Why there is no other man in my life 
That's easy There was 
He's dead 
I'm sorry for asking 
I forgot we said no questions 
Nothing can stop them now 
I'm on their blacklist already 
Their roll of honor 
Moonlight and love songs Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny 
It's still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by 
You said it 
Here's looking at you kid 
My German's a little rusty 
It's the Gestapo 
They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow 
It's pretty bad timing 
Where were you say 10 years ago 
10 years ago 
Let's see 
Yes I was having a brace put on my teeth 
Where were you 
Looking for a job 
Was that cannon fire 
Or is it my heart pounding 
And getting closer every minute 
Here here drink up 
We'll never finish the other three 
And don't forget there's a price on your head 
It's strange 
I know so very little about you 
I know very little about you 
No we must leave 
Yes of course We 
The train for Marseilles leaves at 5:00 
I'll pick you up at your hotel at 4:30 No no 
Not at my hotel 
I have things to do in the city before I leave 
I'll meet you at the station 
All right at a quarter to 5 
Why don't we get married in Marseilles 
That's too far ahead to plan 
Yes I guess it is too far ahead 
Let's see What about the engineer 
Why can't he marry us on the train 
Why not 
Hey what's wrong kid 
I love you so much 
And I hate this war so much 
It's a crazy world 
Anything can happen 
If you shouldn't get away 
Kiss me 
Kiss me as if it were the last time 
Where is she Have you seen her 
I can't find her 
She checked out of the hotel 
But this note came just after you left 
That's the last call Mr Richard 
Do you hear me 
Rick I have to talk to you 
I saved my first drink to have with you Here 
No Rick Not tonight Especially tonight 
Why did you have to come to Casablanca 
There are other places 
I wouldn't have come if I'd known you were here 
Believe me Rick it's true I didn't know 
Richard dear I'll go with you anyplace 
We'll get on a train and never stop 
Don't Rick 
I can understand how you feel 
You understand how I feel 
How long was it we had honey 
I didn't count the days 
Well I did 
Every one of them 
Mostly I remember the last one 
The wild finish 
Can I tell you a story Rick 
Does it got a wild finish 
I don't know the finish yet 
Go on tell it 
Maybe one'll come to you as you go along 
A very great and courageous man 
Yes that's very pretty 
I heard a story once 
In fact I've heard a lot of stories in my time 
Tell me who was it you left me for 
I would suggest you search the café immediately 
You give him credit for too much cleverness 
We mustn't underestimate American blundering 
There is nothing we can do 
I'm delighted to see you 
Did you have a good night's rest 
I slept very well 
Strange 
With pleasure 
Won't you sit down 
Thank you 
So far you have been fortunate in eluding us 
You have reached Casablanca 
Whether or not you will succeed is problematic 
I'm afraid not 
My regrets monsieur 
Well perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca 
You needn't be concerned about me 
Is that all you wish to tell us 
You may be in Casablanca indefinitely 
And that is 
Even Berlin 
Yes even in Berlin 
And the honor of having served the Third Reich 
I was in a German concentration camp for a year 
That's honor enough for a lifetime 
You will give us the names 
What if you murdered all of us 
Even Nazis can't kill that fast 
But in one aspect you are mistaken 
But there is one exception 
You won't dare to interfere with me here 
This is still unoccupied France 
Monsieur insofar as it is in my power 
Thank you 
Yes 
I believe you have a message for him 
Nothing important 
But may I speak to him now 
I'm making out the report now 
Are you quite finished with us 
For the time being 
Good day 
Excuse me captain 
Another visa problem has come up 
Show her in 
Ferrari 
You will find him at the Blue Parrot 
Thanks 
Don't be too downhearted 
Hello Ferrari 
Good morning Rick 
The bus is in 
I'll take my shipment with me 
I'll have it sent over 
Carrying charges my boy Carrying charges 
Here sit down 
Of course not 
Practically no one 
If I had those letters I could make a fortune 
So could I and I'm a poor businessman 
I'll handle the entire transaction 
And the carrying charges 
I'll tell him when he comes in 
Rick I think you know where those letters are 
That's why I came here 
To give them a chance to ransack my place 
Rick don't be a fool 
Excuse me I'll be getting back 
Morning 
Only 700 francs 
You're being cheated 
Doesn't matter thank you 
For friends of Rick's we have a small discount 
Did I say 700 francs 
You can have it for 200 
Doesn't matter 
Your story had me a little confused 
Or maybe it was the bourbon 
I have some tablecloths napkins 
Thank you 
I'm really not interested Please one minute 
Why did you come back 
Yes 
Well you can tell me now 
I'm reasonably sober 
I don't think I will Rick 
I think I'm entitled to know 
Last night I saw what has happened to you 
But the one who looked at me with such hatred 
Not last night 
You can believe that if you want to 
Well I'm not running away anymore 
I'm settled now 
All the same someday you'll lie to Laszlo 
You'll be there 
No Rick 
You see Victor Laszlo is my husband 
And was even when I knew you in Paris 
You see my dear word has gone around 
You however are a different matter 
You mean for me to go on alone 
And only alone 
I'll stay here and keep on trying 
I'm sure in a little while 
Might as well be frank monsieur 
We are only interested in two visas 
Please Ilsa don't be hasty 
No Victor 
You two will want to discuss this 
Excuse me 
I'll be at the bar 
No Ilsa I won't let you stay here 
You must get to America 
Believe me somehow I will get out and join you 
Yes I would 
Yes I see 
I meant to but something always held me up 
I love you very much Ilsa 
Your secret will be safe with me 
Ferrari is waiting for our answer 
Not more than 50 francs 
We've decided Signor Ferrari 
Thank you very much 
Well good luck but be careful 
You know you're being shadowed Of course 
It becomes an instinct 
Because it cannot possibly profit me 
Yes something 
You know where they are 
Not for sure 
A difficult customer that Rick 
One never knows what he'll do or why 
But it is worth a chance 
Thank you very much 
Good day 
Goodbye Thank you for your coffee 
I shall miss that when we leave Casablanca 
Monsieur 
Good day 
Here's to you sir 
Good luck 
I'd better be going 
My check please 
I have to warn you sir 
This is a dangerous place Full of vultures 
Vultures everywhere Thanks for everything 
Goodbye 
It has been a pleasure to meet you 
I'm sorry 
Well drinking I'm very pleased with you 
You're beginning to live like a Frenchman 
That was some going over your men gave my place 
We barely got cleaned up in time to open 
But I told my men to be especially destructive 
You know how that impresses Germans 
Rick have you got those letters of transit 
Louis are you Pro Vichy or Free French 
Serves me right for asking a direct question 
The subject is closed 
It looks like you're a little late 
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy 
Who knows 
Sascha 
Put up a whole row of them Sascha 
Starting here and ending here 
We will begin with two 
What did you say 
Would you kindly repeat it 
What I said is none of your business 
I'll make it my business 
I don't like disturbances in my place 
Either lay off politics or get out 
You see captain 
We try to cooperate with your government 
Captain are you certain which side you're on 
I have no conviction if that's what you mean 
And if it should change 
Surely the Reich doesn't admit that possibility 
We are concerned about more than Casablanca 
A leader Like Laszlo 
I have been thinking 
I see what you mean 
Thank you Carl 
Thank you Carl 
Sit down Have a brandy with us 
To celebrate our leaving for America tomorrow 
Thank you very much 
At last the day's came 
A very nice idea 
To America 
To America 
What watch 
Ten watch 
Such much 
You will get along beautifully in America 
How is lady luck treating you 
Oh too bad 
You'll find him over there 
Monsieur Rick Yes 
Could I speak to you please 
How'd you get in 
You're underage 
I came with Captain Renault 
I should have known 
My husband is with me too 
He is 
Captain Renault's getting broad minded 
Sit down 
Have a drink 
No of course not 
You mind if I do 
Like any other man only more so 
No I mean is he trustworthy 
Just a minute Who told you to ask me that 
He did Captain Renault did 
I thought so 
Where's your husband 
Oh of course he's losing 
How long have you been married 
Eight weeks 
We come from Bulgaria 
Things are very bad there 
The devil has the people by the throat 
So Jan and I we 
So you decided to go to America 
Yes 
It was much more than we thought to get here 
Yes I'll bet 
He tells me he can give us an exit visa 
But we have no money 
Does he know that 
Yes 
And he's still willing to give you a visa 
And you want to know 
Will he keep his word 
He always has 
Monsieur you are a man 
could you forgive her 
Nobody ever loved me that much 
You want my advice 
Yes please 
Go back to Bulgaria 
Oh but if Jan should find out 
He is such a boy 
In many ways I am so much older than he is 
Yes well everybody in Casablanca has problems 
Yours may work out You'll excuse me 
Thank you monsieur 
Good evening Good evening 
You see Here we are again 
I take that as a great compliment to Sam 
I suppose he means to you Paris of happier days 
He does Could we have a table close to him 
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible 
Paul table 30 Yes sir 
Right this way if you please 
Thank you 
Two cognacs please 
Do you wish to place another bet sir 
No 
No I guess not 
Have you tried 22 tonight 
I said 22 
Leave it there 
Cash it in and don't come back 
Are you sure this place is honest 
Honest 
As honest as the day is long 
How are we doing tonight 
He's just a lucky guy 
Monsieur Rick may I get you a cup of coffee 
No thanks Carl Monsieur Rick 
Captain Renault may I Not here 
Come to my office in the morning 
We'll do everything businesslike 
We'll be there at 6 
I'll be there at 10 
I'm very happy for both of you 
Still it's very strange that you won 
Well maybe not so strange 
Boss you've done a beautiful thing 
Go away you crazy Russian 
As I suspected 
You're a rank sentimentalist 
Yeah Why 
Why do you interfere with my little romances 
Put it down as a gesture to love 
Well I'll forgive you this time 
And it'll make me very happy if she loses 
Mr Blaine I wonder if I could talk to you 
Go ahead 
Well isn't there some other place 
It's rather confidential what I have to say 
In my office 
Right 
You know what I've been doing 
I'm not interested in politics 
I'm a saloonkeeper 
You ran guns to Ethiopia 
You fought against the fascists in Spain 
What of it 
Yes I found that a very expensive hobby 
But then I never was much of a businessman 
I appreciate it but I don't accept it 
200 000 
There must be some reason why you won't let me 
There is 
I suggest that you ask your wife 
I beg your pardon 
I said ask your wife 
My wife 
Yes 
Play La Marseillaise Play it 
See what I mean 
I advise that this place be shut up at once 
But everybody's having a good time 
Yes much too good a time 
The place is to be closed 
But I have no excuse to close it 
Find one 
Everybody is to leave immediately 
This café is closed until further notice 
Clear the room at once 
How can you close me up 
Your winnings sir 
Thank you 
Everybody out at once 
Occupied France 
Under safe conduct from me 
Of what value is that 
There are two other alternatives for him 
What are they 
The other alternative 
Good night mademoiselle 
What happened with Rick 
We'll discuss it later 
Our faithful friend is still there 
I must 
Tell you the truth I'm frightened too 
Shall I remain here in a hotel room hiding 
Or shall I carry on the best I can 
Whatever I'd say you would carry on 
Victor why don't you tell me about Rick 
What did you find out 
Apparently he has the letters 
Yes 
But no intention of selling them 
Did he give any reason 
He suggested I ask you 
Ask me 
Yes he said Ask your wife 
I don't know why he said that 
I'll be going in a few minutes 
Ilsa I 
Yes 
Yes Victor I was 
I know how it is to be lonely 
Is there anything you wish to tell me 
No Victor there isn't 
I love you very much my dear 
Yes 
Yes I know 
You don't even have to say it 
I'll believe 
Good night dear 
Good night 
Yes dear 
Be careful 
Of course I'll be careful 
Well you are in pretty good shape Herr Rick 
How long can I afford to stay closed 
Two weeks maybe three 
In the meantime everybody stays on salary 
Thank you Herr Rick 
Sascha will be happy to hear it 
I owe him money 
You finish locking up will you Carl 
I will 
Then I am going to the meeting 
Don't tell me where you're going 
I won't 
Good night 
Good night Mr Rick 
How did you get in 
The stairs from the street 
Well won't you sit down 
Richard I had to see you Richard again 
We're back in Paris 
It was your cause too 
I'm the only cause I'm interested in 
I wouldn't believe you no matter what you said 
You'd say anything now to get what you want 
You want to feel sorry for yourself don't you 
You're a coward and a weakling 
No Oh Richard 
I'm sorry 
I'm sorry but you are our last hope 
What of it 
Now if you'll 
All right 
I tried to reason with you 
I tried everything 
Now I want those letters 
Get them for me 
I don't have to I got them right here 
Put them on the table 
No 
For the last time put them on the table 
All right I'll make it easier for you 
Go ahead and shoot You'll be doing me a favor 
Richard I tried to stay away 
I thought I would never see you again 
That you were out of my life 
If you knew how much I loved you 
How much I still love you 
And then 
Just a two line item in the paper: 
I was frantic For months I tried to get word 
Then it came 
He was dead Shot trying to escape 
I was lonely 
I had nothing not even hope 
Then I met you 
Why weren't you honest with me 
Why'd you keep your marriage a secret 
It wasn't my secret Richard 
Victor wanted it that way 
That was his way of protecting me 
I knew so much about his work 
And when did you first find out he was alive 
A friend came and told me that Victor was alive 
He was sick He needed me 
I wanted to tell you but I didn't dare 
Well well you know the rest 
Well it's still a story without an ending 
What about now 
Now 
I don't know 
And Laszlo 
You'll help him now Richard won't you 
You'll see that he gets out 
All except one 
He won't have you 
I can't fight it anymore 
I ran away from you once I can't do it again 
Oh I don't know what's right any longer 
You have to think for both of us 
For all of us 
All right 
I will 
Here's looking at you kid 
I wish I didn't love you so much 
I think we lost them 
Yes 
I'm afraid they caught some of the others 
Come inside 
Come Mr Laszlo I will help you immediately 
Carl what happened 
Come up here a minute Yes I come 
Turn out the light in the rear entrance 
It might attract the police 
But Sascha always puts out that light 
Tonight he forgot 
Yes I come I will do it 
I want you to take Miss Lund home 
Yes sir 
This might come in handy 
Thank you 
Had a close one eh 
Yes rather 
I mean what you're fighting for 
We might as well question why we breathe 
If we stop breathing we'll die 
What of it Then it'll be out of its misery 
You know how you sound Monsieur Blaine 
Each of us has a destiny 
For good or for evil 
I get the point 
I wonder if you do 
You seem to know all about my destiny 
I know that you're in love with a woman 
I ask only one thing 
You won't give me the letters of transit 
All right 
But I want my wife to be safe 
You love her that much 
Well I am also a human being 
Yes I love her that much 
Monsieur Laszlo 
Yes 
On what charge 
It seems that destiny has taken a hand 
You haven't any proof and you know it 
This isn't Germany or occupied France 
If you were to help him escape 
Because one you bet 10 000 francs he'd escape 
Two you've got the letters of transit 
Don't bother to deny it 
As a matter of fact I don't either 
They're all excellent reasons 
Don't count too much on my friendship 
In this matter I'm powerless 
Besides I might lose the 10 000 francs 
You're not very subtle but you are effective 
I get the point 
Yes I have the letters 
But I intend using them myself 
And I'm taking a friend with me 
One you'll appreciate 
What friend 
Ilsa Lund 
The last man I want to see in America 
You didn't come here to tell me this 
You have the letters of transit 
What makes you think we want to hold you 
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife 
Louis I'll make a deal with you 
Be quite a feather in your cap right 
Certainly 
Germany Vichy would be very grateful 
Then release him 
You get him and we get away 
She isn't just any woman 
I see 
I'm gonna miss you 
Oh thanks 
Go ahead Ricky 
Call off your watchdogs when you let him go 
I don't want them around this afternoon 
I'm taking no chances Louis not even with you 
To get out of Casablanca and go to America 
You're a lucky man 
That still goes 
Of course 
Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them 
Well so long 
I shall remember to pay it to myself 
You're late 
I asked you to tie up your watchdogs 
He won't be followed here 
This place will never be the same without you 
Is everything ready 
I have the letters right here 
When we searched the place where were they 
Sam's piano 
Serves me right for not being musical 
Here they are 
You better wait in my office 
Not yet 
But you were able to arrange everything 
Everything is quite all right 
We'll tell him at the airport 
The less time to think the easier 
Please trust me 
Yes I will 
I don't know how to thank you 
Save it We've still lots of things to do 
I brought the money 
Keep it you'll need it in America 
But we made a deal 
Never mind that 
You won't have any trouble in Lisbon No 
It's all arranged Good 
I've got the letters here made out in blank 
All you have to do is fill in the signatures 
Victor Laszlo 
Victor Laszlo you're under arrest 
You're surprised about my friend Ricky 
The explanation is simple 
Not for a while yet 
Have you lost your mind I have 
Sit down 
Put that gun down 
Under the circumstances I will sit down 
Keep your hands on the table 
I wonder if you realize what this means 
I do 
We've got time to discuss that later 
Call off your watchdogs you said 
That is my least vulnerable spot 
Hello Is that the airport 
This is Captain Renault speaking 
There's to be no trouble about them 
Good 
My car quickly 
This is Major Strasser 
At once do you hear 
Hello radio tower 
Visibility 1 1/2 miles 
Light ground fog 
Depth of fog approximately 500 
Ceiling unlimited 
Thank you 
Certainly Rick anything you say 
This way please 
You think of everything don't you 
And the names are Mr and Mrs Victor Laszlo 
But why my name Richard 
Because you're getting on that plane 
I don't understand 
What about you 
I'm staying with him till the plane gets away 
No What has happened 
Last night you said 
Last night we said a great many things 
You said I was to do the thinking for us 
I've done a lot of it since then 
It adds up to one thing: 
Now you've got to listen to me 
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist 
You're saying this only to make me go 
I'm saying it because it's true 
But what about us 
We'll always have Paris 
We got it back last night 
When I said I would never leave you 
And you never will 
But I've got a job to do too 
Ilsa I'm no good at being noble 
Someday you'll understand that 
Here's looking at you kid 
Everything is in order 
All except one thing 
There's something you should know 
I don't ask you to explain anything 
You said you knew about Ilsa and me Yes 
She came there for the letters of transit 
Isn't that true Ilsa 
Yes 
But that was all over long ago 
I understand 
Here it is 
Thanks 
I appreciate it 
Welcome back to the fight 
This time I know our side will win 
Are you ready Ilsa 
Yes I'm ready 
Goodbye Rick 
God bless you 
You better hurry You'll miss that plane 
I was right 
You are a sentimentalist 
Stay where you are 
I don't know what you're talking about 
What you just did for Laszlo 
I know a little about women my friend 
She went But she knew you were lying 
Anyway thanks for helping me out 
Especially for you 
I'll have to arrest you of course 
As soon as the plane goes Louis 
What was the meaning of that phone call 
Victor Laszlo is on that plane 
Why do you stand here Why don't you stop him 
Ask Monsieur Rick 
Get away from that phone 
I advise you not to interfere 
Put that phone down 
Get me the radio tower 
Put it down 
Major Strasser has been shot 
Round up the usual suspects 
Maybe but it seemed like a good time to start 
I think perhaps you're right 
I could be induced to arrange a passage 
My letter of transit 
I could use a trip 
But it doesn't change our bet 
You still owe me 10 000 francs 
That 10 000 francs should pay our expenses 
Our expenses Mm hm 
Dearest Stephanie 
It all began that night we arrived in Istanbul 
Mr Graham 
Mrs Graham 
Put it there 
It's a pleasure 
You doubt that I am Kopeikine 
No 
You think perhaps that I am not he 
My credentials 
Stephanie take my word for it 
Aren't we Mr Graham 
We got some business to talk over Official 
Oh can't we talk right here 
And bother your charming wife 
Oh Well don't mind me 
If you have to talk to Mr Kopeikine dear 
Well go to the bar if you want to dear 
Maybe we will have a couple of drinks too 
Have a good time 
It's not a good time it's business he says 
Time is fleeing Howard 
The company representative 
I'll be right back Be careful 
Howard where are you going 
I thought you said we're going in the bar 
I know a much better place Come on 
Oh I haven't got my hat and coat 
It's just around the corner 
He just took it for granted I didn't 
He dragged me off to that nightclub 
That's how I happened to meet that woman 
Josette 
Some number huh 
I'd better get on back to the hotel 
You might take a shine to Josette 
After all this little girl is very stupid 
Of course Josette is stupid too but she has it 
Pardon me Howard I will be back very briefly 
You give me money 
What for 
Tip Oh 
You excuse me 
If you like me I come back 
I want you to meet my friend He's American 
You will sit please Thank you 
I enjoyed your dancing very much Mamselle 
Nonsense to say that Americans are not polite 
You hear that Howard 
How long do you stay here Mr Graham 
Why he leaves here tomorrow too 
Yes I'm leaving on the morning train 
I'm going as far as Batoumi by boat 
He is good ain't he Howard 
You sir 
Ladies and gentlemen 
And now ladies and gentlemen 
I will join my ancestors 
Don't worry Howard 
Ah there you are Howard 
That was a good trick What happened 
The boy didn't fire his gun someone else did 
The magician is dead 
That's why they're after me 
This is terrible 
I've got to call my wife 
You've got to keep this out of the paper 
Howard you are lucky 
It's entirely beside the point 
I've got no business in here 
Official duty 
The whole thing's so stupid 
I can forgive almost anything but stupidity 
Wish I'd brought my topcoat 
This is a scandal 
We have no business with the police 
Maybe we won't get our pictures in the papers 
Who's that 
That's Colonel Haki This is his office 
 
But I don't believe it 
He is a great patriot 
But I wouldn't trust him with a woman 
Colonel Haki will see Mr Howard Graham now 
That's us Howard 
Come 
You are Howard Graham 
Yes 
What of it 
What 
An armament manufacturer 
Bainbridge and Sons No thank you 
This man can tell you all about it 
He's the local agent 
We know that Then why ask me 
You're a naval ordinance expert Expert 
Pardon 
I've got my instructions 
I've been ordered back to the States at once 
I'm only stopping here overnight 
I'm doing my best to steer clear of trouble 
What do 
Don't be silly 
The company would send out another man 
I'm not indispensable 
Or England To do my work over again 
Meanwhile the spring will be here 
You are our military objective 
I don't understand you 
You never ride horses nor climb mountains 
You do not hunt big game 
I'm sure you never think of death 
Mr Graham 
Someone is trying to kill you 
You see 
why did you take him to that cabaret 
He wanted a good time 
Pardon me Howard I will be back in a jiffy 
Pardon me Mr Graham 
I have quite a bad headache 
I have here so much work so much anxiety 
We know who's trying to kill you 
Here is his picture 
He doesn't look very friendly 
Banat 
I thought you said his name was Mueller 
Mueller is his employer 
This man's name is supposed to be Peter Banat 
He is an assassin a professional 
Banat is one of them 
And expenses 
Now 
Tonight we learn Banat is here 
But then I am dumbfounded every 25 minutes 
Can't you arrest this man 
We will when we find him 
But now we must get you back safely to America 
It is always the same 
Yes we are leaving tonight for Batoumi 
This man is your husband 
We are partners 
My car is at your disposal 
Good night Mr Graham Good night 
Yet they carry a few passengers twelve at most 
What do you mean go by boat 
I've got a reservation on the morning train 
Oh I don't know 
That's quite a decision 
Graham 
I'm not asking you to decide anything 
I'm telling you what you must do 
I hope I make myself clear Quite clear 
Would you like to handcuff me now 
Haki Colonel Haki 
You two know each other How do you do 
Oh yes 
What about my 
I've just got to see 
I've got to talk to her 
Putting her mind at rest 
That girl Josette had nothing to do with it 
I thought you were going by train Mr Graham 
Howard wait 
I came to say goodbye 
Do you approve of my going on this boat 
I do Howard 
By the way have you a gun in your luggage 
I haven't got any luggage 
Then you better take this 
What did she say 
Here 
I don't need this 
I never fired one of these things you know 
That's a good one Howard What 
Well I just never did 
Look Howard they are loosing it 
You'd better go Come 
Write me a line 
Uh 
Goodbye 
Goodbye Howard 
I was just going to telephone my wife 
What's that 
Cows 
Mostly cows 
It's clever isn't it 
What's clever 
What 
War is war 
You have your passport 
Oh yes 
Oh I've got my wife's here too 
And I see you're arming yourself 
It's one thing to be a soldier is it not 
The fellow next to you will do just as nicely 
That's Stephanie's 
you can run away without being a coward 
Do not worry about your wife Graham 
I will take care of her personally 
Happy journey 
This way 
Cabin 2 
Are you Cabin 2 
Graham Howard 
Yes 
Haven't you got any better accommodations 
The cabins are all the same Monsieur 
I haven't got any luggage 
No luggage 
That's right no luggage 
What do you mean 
Tell me truthfully why you are on this boat 
You wouldn't believe me 
Very well I'm not inquisitive 
I apologize 
India perhaps I do not know I hope so 
So much is closed on account of the war 
How long have you been dancing 
Since I was 10 that's 20 years ago 
You see I do not lie to you about my age 
But honest no doubt 
Oh no my father was not at all honest 
You are English sir 
American 
I am Turkish 
I sell tobacco 
Thermo Pazar and Company 
My name is Mr Kuvetli sir 
My name is Howard Graham 
This is Mademoiselle Josette So good 
We produce best Please 
It's stuffy in here I would like to go outside 
You will come with me 
Thank you Mr Kuvetli Will you join us 
Cannot you be quiet 
You are keeping the whole ship awake Shh 
I'm terribly sorry 
See you later Yes please 
I do not like that man 
Personally I like the Turks 
Would you like to go upstairs 
I really ought to get some sleep 
As you wish 
It's been quite a night 
Wish I'd brought my topcoat 
It is pretty up there 
Gogo is probably asleep 
He will want to play cards with you tomorrow 
I'll try to think of a game that I play well 
He would win in any case but I have warned you 
I'll remember that when I lose 
I think maybe I'm a coward 
I'm scared 
Hello 
Good afternoon 
My name is Haller Dr Fritz Haller 
Mine is Howard Graham 
I should explain I am a German 
A good German of the former Germany 
I am on my way back to Tehran 
I am travelling on a League of Nations passport 
I'm an American 
This steward is an imbecile 
I agree with you there 
You've been long in Turkey 
A few weeks 
I came there from Persia 
Oil 
No Mr Graham Archeology Oh 
War 
Money 
You say that 
Well I take no side I do not care who wins 
War is terrible 
Thirst for food and tongues for the wise 
War is the last refuge of the capitalist 
They're more ferocious as patriots than the men 
Don't you agree sir 
Me 
Please 
I am neutral you understand 
Tobacco 
In Istanbul 
What company 
Pazar and Company Istanbul Pazar 
I don't under 
I see 
There is Trabzon 
Good afternoon 
Good afternoon 
Good afternoon is that all you have to say 
What should I say 
The steward says you're still in your cabin 
Excuse 
I didn't get to bed until 6 Oh 
How do you do 
Do you play poker 
Why certainly 
But not very well 
I told you 
She thinks because I win I cheat 
I do not care what she thinks 
Well it is illogical 
It's very boring to listen to english 
I'm going to drink some brandy 
Let's go out on deck 
He's very unpleasant today 
It's because he's disappointed 
Are you coming 
Sorry Mr 
That's right One message two addresses 
Send it right off 
That's fine thank you 
See you Grand Hôtel Batoumi Saturday 
I love you only you 
Very good sir 
Ah there you are Professor 
Good razor thank you Not at all 
Didn't go ashore 
Oh so that is his name 
He speaks german quite well 
I think he's traveled quite a bit 
He is too simple to be true 
Who ever heard of a simple Turkish businessman 
No he is a man who wishes to be underrated 
Why 
He's not trying to sell us tobacco 
We have a new passenger 
Quiet she'll hear you 
Why I didn't go 
I was but 
Yes 
I want to talk to the Captain 
Now what's the matter Monsieur 
I want to be put ashore 
It's too late 
The pilot boat is gone 
I'm willing to pay 
This is a ship Monsieur Not a taxi 
We carry cargo around on a schedule 
This is a question of life and death 
Well naturally 
I am not crazy 
No not at all Monsieur 
Now what's his name 
Banat 
Just a minute 
What's so funny 
There's no one by that name 
The number 7 cabin 
I don't know what his number is 
Why he's a Greek businessman 
We are no longer in Turkish territorial waters 
I tell you the man means to kill me 
Why 
Because he's been paid to kill me 
Who pays him 
The 
Can't you speak english 
But I understand 
There are too many people 
Now if you'll excuse me I have work to do 
And if you close the door as you go out 
Boom boom 
Hello Mr Graham Good evening 
What are you doing out there 
You'll catch cold come back to bed 
Have you got a wife sir 
Yes I have Excuse me 
You're lucky 
For years I lived in misery 
Then one day I made a great discovery 
There was a socialist meeting and I went to it 
I wasn't a socialist understand 
She wept 
Then I knew that I was free 
My wife became very docile 
I see 
So you don't believe these things you say 
No 
That's where my little joke comes in 
So here I am 
Josette 
Banking 
What is banking but usury 
And where has our American been 
There are so many poor people it is terrible 
Banking 
What does he know about banking 
I thought you were ill sir You are better now 
Yes thanks 
You've been ill 
I felt tired 
It is the ventilation 
We should complain 
Mrs Matthews is right 
The ventilation isn't good 
I think we should go outside 
I know you must be ill you are polite 
I'll go with you 
It was not at all stuffy in the saloon 
Now you shall tell me what is really the matter 
They have a special look about them 
And they can't keep their hands still 
I'm glad we can walk like this together 
Yes I remember It was a bad joke 
A very bad joke Only it's true 
You're lying to me 
I'm afraid not 
Nothing 
You are lying 
Yes I am lying but not very much 
Who are they 
I only know one 
His name is Mueller or Miller or something 
He lives in Sofia he's a Nazi agent 
The salaud 
But he cannot touch you now 
I'm afraid he can 
That fat man aboard is working for him 
The Greek 
He's not a Greek 
His real name is Banat 
He's been hired to kill me 
How do you know 
I've seen his picture 
This is not very nice No it's not 
He knows you suspect him he was watching you 
Kuvetli was watching you also 
You look so curious you see 
You mean I look frightened 
Frightened to death 
I was frightened I'll admit it 
Why shouldn't I be 
I'm not used to people trying to kill me 
Besides somebody's stolen my gun 
You needn't worry 
I can tell you something 
His clothes are tight 
He's got a gun I know 
He must keep it in his cabin 
He's in the saloon now 
How 
Gogo will do it 
Will Gogo ask him 
Are you sure he can keep him in there 
I'll make certain 
You wait here 
Won't you join me Mr Graham 
I'm just getting some fresh air Oh 
I used to like both Now I dislike both 
Movement is change 
And to an old man change means death 
Excuse me 
Good night Mademoiselle 
I mustn't stay 
Boom boom 
Oh Mr Graham I have been waiting for you 
Close the door please 
Banat 
Banat's easier to say 
I wonder if your name happens to be Mueller 
You have guessed it Mr Graham I am Mueller 
But I rather like myself as an archeologist 
I got my little speeches from this 
The Sumerian Pantheon by Fritz Haller 
That is all we're interested in 
Mr Graham you are a fortunate man 
What does that mean 
You are going to catch typhus What 
In six weeks you will have recovered 
How does that appeal to you Mr Graham 
Graham you are a fool 
You know nothing nothing 
Oh I don't 
You see what I mean Mr Graham 
It's a solemn thought isn't it 
Graham 
Graham 
Go to the wall 
I'm in the next cabin 
Well 
This is Kuvetli 
We'll meet on the well deck in five minutes 
Leave before me and wait there 
All right 
Where are you 
Here Graham 
From Colonel Haki to you 
Did you know that Mueller was aboard 
Did you overhear that too 
He underrates you Graham 
Oh 
Not necessarily 
What with 
Death 
That'd be a little silly wouldn't it 
Not so silly Graham 
You must obey my orders Well 
I'm a Turk Graham 
I fought with the Gazi for Turkey's freedom 
I guess not 
I'll do anything you say Good 
It's empty Stay there 
Now do you understand 
Yes I think I do 
You feel better now hmm 
Good luck Graham 
You have seen Kuvetli 
I have 
Well 
I've decided to accept your advice 
At Kuvetli's suggestion 
My own 
Did he mention me by name 
Yes He warned me against you 
And how did you treat the warning 
I've decided to ignore it and follow your plan 
Kuvetli will cause no trouble 
I'll be back in a minute Come in here sir 
I need your help Why certainly 
Mr Matthews in a way at the moment 
You're in the American secret service 
What's the message 
Tell him to tell Colonel Haki 
H A K I in Istanbul that I'm in trouble 
Is that all Well 
Of course Mr Graham 
I'd like to say something about my wife 
Wait a minute 
Did you say you had a revolver 
Why no I haven't got any revolver Oh 
But I thought of course that you had 
I'm sorry Mr Graham 
I'll deliver your message though 
Thanks 
She will come back 
Why don't you sit down and wait 
You don't understand eh 
She is very pretty no But she has no sense 
You wish to marry her 
What 
I do not give her up for nothing 
It's a lot of money huh 
Look But I will give her up 
Have you got a revolver 
A revolver 
Oh sure only 
Then we can talk about all of this later 
Well chéri is everything settled 
He wants us to meet him later No I mean 
Your car is waiting Mr Graham Oh

He says she's waiting for you upstairs 
Tell her to hold her horses 
Your devoted husband 
Howard 
My compliments Graham 
Banat is a dangerous man you had no gun 
I got mad 
I spent too much time running away 
The only public advance was the street car 
But the long contagion of the derby had arrived: 
In those days they had time for everything: 
There it is 
The Amberson mansion 
The pride of the town 
Well well $60 000 for the woodwork alone 
Is Miss Amberson at home 
No sir Mr Morgan Miss Amberson's not home 
Well thanks Sam 
Thanks 
I guess she's still mad at him 
Isabel Major Amberson's daughter 
Eugene Morgan's her best beau 
Wilbur Wilbur Minafer 
I never thought he'd get her 
Wilbur Minafer 
To think of her taking' him 
Made her think he didn't care much about her 
She couldn't love Wilbur could she 
Well It'll all go to her children 
And she'll ruin them 
Hey Go I guess you think you own this town 
His what 
I only want to be there 
Nah the little girly curly 
Nah the little girly curly 
Your sister stole it for me 
You go get your hair cut 
I dare you outside that gate 
I dare ya half way here I dare ya 
Little boy 
That'll be enough of that 
You stop that you 
I guess you don't know who I am 
Yes I do and you're a disgrace to your mother 
Be silent you billy goat you 
What 
Dear did you say what he says you did 
No you shouldn't say 
Wait'll they send him away to school 
But George returned with the same stuffing 
Bloody siz 
Cards were out for a ball in his honour 
Now don't you look at me like that Major 
Georgie 
Where's Fanny 
Isabel 
This your boy Isabel

Tomorrow  Thank you Isabel 
I'll get your things 
Fanny where are you going 
Well 
I will 
Oh nothing 
Here hold this 
I he's a man with a pretty daughter Georgie 
He certainly seems to be awfully at home here 
Ancient recollections Georgie 
You mean she used to be silly about him 
Oh she wasn't considered er singular 
Oh dry up I only wanted to know 
Good night Isabel Good night Eugene 
Oh he's still only a boy 
Plenty of fine stuff in him 
You liked her pretty well once I guess Papa 
Do still 
I know that isn't all that's worrying you 
Well several things 
Why 
It seems to me he looks so badly 
I think the worry's affected his health 
What investments 
Oh no The automobile concern is all Eugene's 
No your father's rolling mills 
Hello dear Have you had trouble sleeping 
Isn't that what he's up to You little silly 
I'll bet he borrows money from Uncle Jack 
Georgie why do you say such a thing 
Just strikes me as that sort of a man 
I'm sure I don't know 
You might ask him 
Aunt Fanny 
What in the world's the matter with you 
What do you mean 
You're his only sister and yet you don't know 
What is the matter with you 
Oh good gracious 
'Night 
This man Morgan Excited Oh shut up 
For who 
For whom Georgie For whom Georgie 
For Mr Morgan and his daughter 
Oh look here; don't do that 
It wouldn't look well 
See here George Minafer 
What upset you this much 
Shut up   I know what you mean 
I'm gonna move to a hotel 
Because he's a widower 
Ohh Is that what you mean 
You attend your own affairs 
Well I will be shot 
I will 
I certainly will be shot 
You think you'll get it to start 
What's wrong with it Gene 
I wish I knew 
Get a horse 
What happened to them 
Oh George 
Are you all right 
Georgie   They're all right Isabel 
They're all right Isabel 
Oh Isabel 
Everything's all right Mother 
That darned horse 
He'll be home long before we will 
Have to sit on my lap Lucy 
Stamp the snow 
You mustn't ride with wet feet 
Get in You're the same Isabel I used to know 
Plus one and minus one equal nothing 
So you mean I'm nothing in particular 
Jack please get We're under way 
Push Georgie; push 
I'm pushing Push harder 
Push Georgie; push 
It really does too you know 
It's so interesting 
Oh it seems so like old times to hear him talk 
You broke the bank at Monte Carlo 
How about that kiss 
Wilbur Minafer quiet man 
Town will hardly know he's gone 
Where did Isabel go to 
She was tired 
Never was becoming to her to look pale 
Look out 
Oh boy 
I hope it's big enough 
You must know I'm coming home Mmm 
What did you say 
Nothing 
Sweet enough 
Fine 
Going a lot 
How could she she's in mourning 
All she could do was sit around and look on 
On the train; we rushed over 
Quit balling your food 
No 
She went home with her father 
Oh I see 
Don't eat so fast George 
So ah 
Eugene came to the station to meet you 
Meet us 
How could he 
I don't know what you mean 
Want some more milk 
No thanks 
Naturally; he's beneath himself 
Did you see him 
Naturally since he made the trip home with us 
He did 
He was with you all the time 
Uncle Jack got him to come along 
You're gonna get fat 
Mm I can't help that 
You're such a wonderful housekeeper 
What's odd 
Didn't think of it I suppose 
What had I better tell him 
Oh Aunt Fanny 
But now I dunno 
Yeah 
Fanny hasn't got much in her life 
Except her feeling about Eugene 
We're now turning out a car and a quarter a day 
Isn't that marvelous What's marvelous 
They're turning out a car and a quarter a day 
Mother 
She never gets the blues George 
An idea most people laughed at him for 
Do you remember this 
Our first machine 
The original Morgan Invincible 
I remember 
How quaint 
Of course I'm happy 
It's beautiful 
Just beautiful 
Did you ever see anything so lovely 
As what 
As you mother She's a darling 
It's just glorious 
It makes us all happy Eugene 
Give him your hand Fanny 
There If brother Jack were here 
I used to write verse about 20 years ago 
remember that 
I remember that too 
Isabel dear 
Yes Eugene 
Don't you think you should tell George 
About us 
There's still time 
I think he should hear it from you 
He will dearest 
Soon 
Soon 
I'll still take a horse any day 
Wo Oh don't 
Why Do you want him to trot his legs off 
No but 
No but what 
I won't Get up Pendennis Go on trot 
Commence 
When are you going to say we're really engaged 
Not for years So there's the answer 
Lucy 
Dear what's the matter 
You look as if you're going to cry 
I know it 
Well why do you 
You haven't any reason or 
I don't know 
Everything's so unsettled 
If you aren't the queerest girl 
What's unsettled 
Well what are you going to do George 
Why I expect to lead an honorable life 
What kind 
if you don't mind 
No I've never once spoken to him about it 
Yes 
George 
Who's dictating your way of life 
George 
Well seems to have recovered 
Looks the highest good spirits 
I beg pardon 
What about 
I wonder what he thinks I'm made of 
What part 
Rolling over it and burying it under 
I miss my best girl We all do 
She'll be back Monday 
Probably afraid to 
Isn't that so Georgie 
Or didn't Lucy tell you she was going 
She told me 
At any rate Georgie didn't approve 
I suppose you two aren't speaking again 
out in the suburbs 
What did you say George 
I said automobiles are a useless nuisance 
Course you forget Mr Morgan makes them 
Also did his share in inventing them 
I'm not sure 
But automobiles have come 
And it may be that George is right 
Well Major if you'll excuse me 
Fanny Oh Eugene ple Isabel 
I'll come to 
He was hurt 
What made you think he was hurt 
I know him 
By Jove Georgie; you are a puzzle 
In what way may I ask 
By Jove 
It's a new way of winning a woman 
George 
Oh what do you want 
Quit the mysterious detective business 
Oh you're always picking on me always 
Ever since you were a little boy 
Nobody nothing Oh my gosh 
How people are talking about your mother 
What did you say 
Look here Because you said Look here 
Just what do you mean 
Hammer her Hammer her 
Oh yes it's always Fanny 
Ridiculous old Fanny Always Always 
He did Anyhow he liked to dance with me 
He danced with me as much as he did with her 
They just thought I didn't count 
It's only Fanny Minafer I suppose they'd say 
What's that Everybody knows it 
You mean Morgan might have married you 
No 
Because I don't know that I'd have accepted him 
Why George 
Don't you know that's what they say 
You must know that everybody in town 
Who told you 
What Who told you there was talk 
Where is this talk 
Where does it come from 
It's pretty general Who said so 
Wha 
How did you get hold of it 
Has she ever mentioned this to you 
Why George 
George 
What are you going to do George 
Mr Amberson 
Heh heh I mean Mr Minafer 
Won't you come in please 
Mrs Johnson 
I don't mean to waste any time Mrs Johnson 
I don't think your aunt can have said that 
Other people That's what I want to know about 
These other people how many 
How many 
What How many other people talk about it 
Heh really this isn't a courtroom 
And I'm not a defendant in a libel suit 
I mean to know just who told you these 
Oh now you have done it 
They can now 
Georgie gossip's never fail till it's denied 
Why shouldn't they marry if they want to 
Your own sister Oh for heaven's sake 
Don't be so theatrical 
Needn't mind Mary 
I'll see who it is and what they want 
Probably it's only a peddler 
Thank you Mr George 
Good afternoon George 
You'll be so kind as to send her word I'm here 
No 
I beg your pardon I said I heard you 
What's the matter 
Or any other day 
I'm afraid I don't understand you 
You're not wanted in this house Mr Morgan 
Now or at any other time 
Perhaps you'll understand this 
Isabel Yes 
I've just come from Eugene 
I want to talk to you 
Well 
I can just guess what that was about 
He's telling her what you did to Eugene 
You go back to your room 
George No you don't Georgie Minafer 
Go on to the top of the stairs Go on 
It's indecent 
The idea of you going in there now 
Jack's telling Isabel the whole thing 
I'm considerate of her good name 
I thought you already knew everything I did 
Oh I was a fool 
And they haven't done any harm 
She made Wilbur happy 
And just ruining them 
Your uncle's leaving 
I'll be back Isabel 
George Let her alone 
She's down there by herself Don't go down 
Let her alone 
Dearest one 
But someone else's fear of it 
Your son's 
Let me explain a little 
I don't think he'll change 
40 can't tell 20 about this 
20 can find out only by getting to be 40 
And so we come to this dear: 
will you live your life your way 
Or George's way 
Are you strong enough Isabel 
Can you make a fight 
I'm saying too much for wisdom I fear 
But oh my dear won't you be strong 
Such a little short strength it would need 
don't strike my life down twice dear 
This time I've not deserved it 
Did you read it dear 
Yes I did 
All of it 
Yes 
Well what do you think Georgie 
What do you mean 
You can see how fair he means to be 
Fair 
What people say 
That Eugene loves me 
He's always loved you 
That's true Georgie 
But you're my mother 
You're an Amberson 
You just 
Yes dear 
I don't know mother 
I'll write Eugene 
He'll understand 
He'll wait 
Be better this way 
We'll go away for awhile you and I 
Lucy you Haven't you 
Haven't I what Nothing 
May I walk with you a little ways 
Is it a funny story 
May seem like one to you 
Just to begin with 
Why no 
I just trotted off for some visits 
Don't you remember we'd had a quarrel 
Play 
Well what we were playing 
That being lovers you mean don't you 
Something like that it was absurd 
This time I'm going away 
That's what I wanted to tell you Lucy 
I'm going away tomorrow night indefinitely 
I hope you have ever so nice a time George 
I don't expect to have a particularly nice time 
Well then if I were you I don't think I'd go 
This is our last walk together Lucy 
Evidently if you're going away tomorrow night 
This is the last time I'll see you ever 
Ever in my life 
My that does sound like a long trip 
I think it would be lovely to 
Lucy I can't stand this 
It's quite a shock Lucy What is 
To find out just how deeply you care 
I can't stand this any longer 
I can't Lucy 
Goodbye Lucy 
It's goodbye 
I do hope that you have the most splendid trip 
Give my love to your mother 
For gosh sake Miss 
It's mighty nice of you Lucy 
I found Isabel as well as usual 
Struck me Isabel oughta be in a wheelchair 
What do you mean by that 
Oh she's cheerful enough 
At least she manages to seem so 
She's pretty short of breath 
Let her 
Does she want to 
She doesn't urge it 
It's quite as well she does want to come 
I see 
And you say he won't let her come home 
Well uh I don't think he uses force 
He's very gentle with her 
Knowing him as I do 
Yes 
Changed 
So change 
You mean you mean the town 
You're going to get well again 
I've come to see your mother George 
I'm sorry Mr Morgan 
Not this time George I'm going up to see her 
I'll be quiet 
I don't think you should right now 
The doctor says 
Fanny's right Gene 
Why don't you come back later 
All right 
She wants to see you 
Darling 
Did you get something to eat 
Yes mother 
All you needed 
Yes mother 
I'm all right mother 
That's sweet 
Sweet 
What is mother darling 
My hand against your cheek 
I can feel it 
I'm sure they do 
Has he asked about me 
Yes 
He was here 
Has he gone 
Yes mother 
I'd like to have seen him just once 
She must rest now 
George 
She loved you 
You loved you 
And now 
Father 
Father Ah 
The house was in Isabel's name wasn't it 
Yes 
No 
No I 
can't just remember It doesn't matter 
You oughta have that deed George 
No don't bother 
The sun 
So whatever we are we must be of the Earth 
Odd way for us to be saying goodbye 
I thought I couldn't live through it 
She stood there crying 
Don't even know where she lives now 
Or if she is living 
If she ever thinks of me she probably imagines 
Last train last train   I must run 
No 
You never did either 
The name was 
Loma Nashah 
Indian names don't 
And his name was It was 
Means rides down everything What 
I see 
Go on 
He'd have to go 
And he never got back 
They didn't want him back of course 
They hated Vendonah 
They couldn't help feeling that way 
I see 
Must have been 
So you're going to stay in your garden 
You think it's better just to 
I had too much unpleasant excitement 
I don't want any more 
In fact 
I don't want anything but you 
You don't 
What was the name of that grove 
Oh Mola Haha 
Mola Haha 
That wasn't the name you said 
Oh I've forgotten 
See you have 
Perhaps you remember the chief's name better 
I don't 
I hope someday you can forget it 
Try and understand 
And we could be together How 
On 8$ a week 
I'll be paying 
I be paying 
Certainly you would 
I've got 28 dollars That's all 
28 dollars That's all 
But I did it 
Every cent 
And it's gone 
Why did you wait till now to tell me 
I couldn't tell till I had to 
It wouldn't do any good 
My gosh 
Oh I know what you're gonna do 
You're you're gonna leave me in the lurch 
I'm only asking you to be reasonable 
Will you get up 
I can't 
I'm too weak 
Oh none of this makes any sense 
Will you get up 
And try and make something like a home for ya 
And I've tried 
I know that 
I I walked and walked over this town 
I didn't ride one block on a streetcar 
Oh for gosh sakes will you get up 
Get up aunt Fanny It's not hot it's cold 
The plumbers disconnected it 
I I wouldn't mind if they hadn't 
I wouldn't mind if it burned 
I wouldn't mind if it burned me George 
Oh Fanny for gosh sakes get up 
Now stop it 
Stop this Do you hear me 
Stop it Stop it 
Listen to me now 
There; that's better 
Now let's see where we stand 
See if we can afford this place you picked out 
I'm sure it's practical 
I know it must be practical aunt Fanny 
It is a comfort to be among among nice people 
There's there's there's one great economy 
They they don't allow tipping 
I've got about a hundred dollars left 
$100 that's all 
Won't need any new clothes for a year 
Perhaps there Or longer 
So so you see 
Yes I see 
I see that $36 and $45 make $81 
That's the lowest We'll need $100 a month 
And I'm going to be making $32 
A real flair 
Real flair for the law 
I can't do it I can't take up the law 
What 
Something that pays from the start 
I want to get started tomorrow if I could 
Well sir it's aunt Fanny 
Struck me that she's just about got to have it 
All right all right 
For the town was growing and changing 
It was heaving up in the middle incredibly 
It was spreading incredibly 
Tomorrow they were to move out 
Tomorrow everything would be gone 
Ma forgive me 
God forgive me 
Something had happened 
Now it came at last 
He got it three times filled and running over 
And they never knew it 
And all about him 
All right stay back there now 
He run into me as much as I run into him 
All right stay back there now 
What are you going to do Papa 
I'm going to him 
You coming Papa 
How is he 
How is Georgie 
He's going to be all right 
Fanny

You can't hold me without a warrant 
I'm trying to explain 
You give me a break 
You'll have it to burn 
What's wrong Mac 
What's holding us up 
Truck ahead blocking the whole road 
Looks like they're changing a tire 
Got a cigarette 
Sure 
All you want 
Hiya bud 
Hey what's the matter 
He went behind those rocks 
Not over here 
There he goes 
There he is 
Hello there 
Hello 
I got caught in this storm 
I'm pretty wet I'm afraid 
Maybe you'd like to come inside and get dry 
Did you leave your car down on the road 
I don't have any car 
You might say I'm traveling by thumb 
By thumb 
Yeah I'm a hitchhiker 
Oh I see 
Yes I guess it is 
Will you go to the fire and dry your clothes 
Thanks 
Oh no thanks 
This is fine 
Why sure 
You must stay until this blows over 
It won't detain you long 
These autumn storms are short 
Yes I 
I'm sorry I should have warned you 
Those logs are heavier than you'd think 
I drop them constantly 
Yes they are heavy 
Good job it didn't land on your foot 
That often happens to me 
You're lucky 
Yeah 
I'm lucky 
Oh I was forgetting 
My name is Phillip Martin 
Oh I'm Barry 
Mason 
You live here alone do you sir 
You see sounds are my light and my colors 
My music for example 
I compose a little 
Undoubtedly you'd prefer listening to them 
Oh that's too bad 
The piano is a boon to me 
It does you the compliment to trust you 
Delius the British composer was blind too 
That's our only resemblance 
This is his Summer Night on the River 
A very interesting effect obligato on an apple 
Oh I apologize Mr Mason 
Just a moment I'll get something 
Oh no 
Thanks 
This is fine 
I like apples 
So do I We'll save them for dessert 
It was all ready you see 
Are you dry enough 
Just about sir 
It stopped raining 
Is that a car coming 
Two cars I think 
Excuse me 
One car is my niece's 
I'd know the sound of that motor anywhere 
The other is a stranger to me 
There's a couple of men in it 
They must've asked her where to go 
This is an easy country to lose your way in 
That's one of its charms 
The girl's coming up the path 
That's my niece 
She's been staying with me 
It's one of my greatest pleasures 
Unhappily for me she can't stay longer 
After a month she finds the quiet deafening 
Oh Uncle Phillip 
Hello old boy 
Uncle Phillip what do you think happened 
You didn't know we had a guest 
You turned your back and see what happens 
My niece Patricia Martin Mr Mason 
How do you do 
They wanted to know the way to town 
But they said this man is really dangerous 
I'm sure they did 
How could they be heroes if he were harmless 
Their remarks are always so expected 
They kill conversation 
Why yes 
I was wondering where I'd seen 
Oh well relatives are like that 
I'm starving 
Oh 
What's the matter Pat 
Have you just seen his handcuffs 
I heard them as soon as he came in 
Yes very probably 
But you should have given him to the police 
Are you frightened Pat 
Is that what makes you so cruel 
But you've got to 
He's a dangerous man 
Oh Pat come on 
Pat don't tell me about my duty 
It makes you sound so stuffy 
They sometimes involve disregarding the law 
I'm going to turn him over to you my dear 
I can see intangible things 
For example innocence 
Will you go with my niece Mr Mason 
Oh yes sir 
If you don't mind 
But what'll I tell the blacksmith 
Tell him Mr Mason is my friend and my guest 
He won't ask any other questions 
Go ahead Pat 
Go with her Barry 
Barry I know is your name 
Your voice explained to me that Mason isn't 
I don't know how to thank you Mr Martin 
Go ahead Barry 
Go ahead 
And do the things I wish I could do 
Is the blacksmith's shop very far 
Not very right along here 
And is he Is he really all right 
He and my uncle are great friends Oh 
I guess he's all right then 
You needn't worry 
He's all right 
Do you mind if I see them 
Could you hold them a little nearer 
Now I feel better 
I'll bet you do 
We're on our way to the police 
Your uncle's certainly gonna be proud of you 
You're gonna find that out 
All right go ahead What did I do 
I'd be kind of happy to know 
That's worse than murder 
Surprise for you Miss Martin 
I agree with every word you say 
Please don't talk to me anymore 
That will be my pleasure 
Well 
I'll see that she doesn't 
Never try driving this way It hurts 
I'm stopping the first car I see 
Help 
Come on I can't get along without you 
Let go of me Help 
Help 
Get the police 
Help 
My they must be terribly in love 
Looks as though this car has been overheated 
Fan's broken 
I'm cold 
Yeah I know 
And you're hungry 
Now mostly I'm cold 
Build a fire 
No I wasn't exactly thinking of that 
What do you want to turn me in for 
I just want to do my duty 
That's hard for you to understand 
Why won't you believe I'm all right 
'Cause you still don't make sense 
I've told you it's a question of time 
Do you think we're very far from Soda City 
I don't know 
Well you believe it about me 
Well you're different 
You look like a saboteur 
You have a saboteur's disposition 
Don't tell me you've decided to be on my side 
No I'm cold 
Hey look at that 
Looks like we've got company 
They aren't moving very fast are they 
You know what we can do 
Oh no you won't 
Sorry honey I can't take a chance 
You're right 
I'd turn you in at the first opportunity I get 
Let go of me 
Let me go 
Ouch 
Help Help 
Won't you give me one break 
Won't you wait till we get to Soda City 
All right 
I'm sorry I've got to leave you here alone 
There're a lot of them out here 
Barry 
Barry please 
Are you with me 
Yes yes 
Now what made you change your mind 
I can't turn you in if I'm stuck out there 
Oh so that's it 
Go back with the reptiles 
Let me go 
Who's there 
You've got no right here 
Stop it and get off 
Now now Major 
Ah stowaways 
Bedouins like ourselves eh Esmeralda 
Why they're just a couple of kids 
Broke down eh 
We didn't pass no wrecks on the highway 
The whole thing sounds like a pack of lies 
You see we were off on a side road 
I know 
A moonlight night and a parked car 
That's nice 
Oh no really we were just 
Esmeralda 
Everywhere you search for sex 
Oh I beg your pardon 
How do you do 
And this is Esmeralda our bearded lady 
You poor kids must be tired 
Come on in and sit down have a little rest 
You must meet our other co worker 
Tatania our little human mountain 
A very great lady indeed 
How do you do 
What goes on there 
Oh did we wake you honey 
That's too bad Oh I was awake 
I've been tossing and turning all night 
Nothing but a common novelty seeker 
Girls girls What will our guests think 
Hey he's cute 
You hear that There she goes again 
Stop your squabbling 
They are tired 
I know 
The normal are normally cold hearted 
Stop gabbing and get these tramps off 
A cold heart partly reduced in size 
I won't take no insults 
Get them off 
Aw Major honey Don't honey me 
I've got a contract 
That's the police all right 
They must be looking for somebody 
Who could they want 
Me I guess 
Oh The carefree youth and he has handcuffs on 
What do they want you for 
For something somebody else did 
I don't believe he's done anything wrong 
I'll go to bat for him anytime 
They're starting to search at the front 
Well what are you waiting for 
Hand him over to the police 
He's perfectly right 
He's a little stinker 
All right Bones call the cops 
Just a minute Major 
We stand defeated at the outset 
No vote I'm against voting 
Fascist 
You know how we stand so far 
Esmeralda the decision is up to you 
Never a word 
Never a question 
We don't give them up 
Good girl Esmeralda 
This is subversive I won't stand for it 
Oh no you don't cuddles 
You'll abide by the will of the majority 
Back into your places and pretend to be asleep 
That's all you have to do 
Here honey you sit right down here 
Come on young man we've got to hide you 
Turn all the lights off 
Here Take off your coat and put this on 
Come on 
Wake up in there Hey what is this 
Halloween 
Police 
Oh is that so 
The dame's supposed to be good looking 
Have you seen them 
Who's this 
Doesn't look like one of your troop 
Sure she's one of us 
She's our little snake charmer 
Can you imagine that 
And a good looking gal too 
Well I guess you can all go back to sleep now 
A snake charmer Well well 
You never can tell about women 
It's all right 
You can come out now 
Wait justice come back Sit down here 
We're on our way 
She's had a tough time 
Poor little girl She's worn out 
I'll take care of her 
Come on 
Let's go 
Better let the snakes get some sleep 
They have to look good tomorrow 
I'm sorry 
What for 
For being such a dope 
Get some sleep 
You'll be fine 
I can go to sleep all right 
I'm so tired 
I want to tell you something 
I believe you 
Do you Pat 
You didn't you know 
It's a free country 
A girl can change her mind can't she 
Sure she can 
Thank you Pat 
They made me so ashamed 
They're so nice and trusting 
Welcome to Soda City 
The heart of the bicarbonate belt 
Well we might as well do the town 
There's nothing here 
I suppose we are a little late 
I'm sorry darling 
I knew I shouldn't have brought you here 
I'm not complaining 
This is great isn't it 
Solution to all my problems 
I was counting on this place 
A dump like this 5 000 miles from nowhere 
Look at this 
It's been in use 
Let's go around to the window 
Careful 
Don't cut yourself 
Hello Hello 
Hung up 
What sort of phone is that 
It's a field telephone 
Well a room with a view 
Say look 
Tripod 
Looks like it's the right height 
Yeah 
Something else goes with this 
There 
That's it 
See anything 
Not yet 
Uh oh 
Let me see 
Why that's a Why Barry 
Yeah 
We better put this away 
Take that 
Say 
The wood 
What about it 
They wouldn't burn that in a stove 
Why not 
The smoke would show 
That's a car 
You better hide 
No not here 
Hey What do you think you're doing around here 
Where are you from 
What are you sniffing around here for 
Excuse me 
Funny you knowing about this place 
I don't quite get it 
You might have thought it over more carefully 
Your coming here doesn't help us a bit 
The heat's on this guy and he shows up here 
Tobin sent me 
Yeah 
Don't talk that way about the old guy 
I'll watch out for myself Doc 
Me too 
Don't forget about me 
That's why Tobin sent me up here 
He said you'd know how to take care of me 
I guess that makes it pretty clear Neilson 
I don't know 
Yes 
Mr Kane has done pretty well down South 
I'm entitled to more than that 
I'm sure the firm will do its best 
You got it easy you guys from back East 
You give orders 
You do that all right 
The big boys with the desk jobs 
Yeah 
Well I'm getting just a little bit tired see 
So am I 
I'm getting tired of all this talk 
Let's get going 
I got no place to hide you out 
That ain't my line 
That ain't your line huh 
What about you 
You don't seem so interested either 
Or I suppose you're just the big brains 
Or maybe it doesn't work that way 
Maybe I'm the only guy that sticks his neck out 
Well get this both of you 
I pulled a big job and they're after me 
I've got to get out of this part of the country 
The ground's burning up under my feet 
I've got to get back East 
Hey take it easy 
Hang on to your nerve 
I think I know him now 
I'm driving back East you know 
You'd better come with me 
All right let's get going 
Get all the things together 
After we leave I want this place cleaned up 
You won't be coming back here 
Why not 
You think they got the place spotted 
I'm making sure 
Well it's not gonna be easy 
All right 
I'll handle it 
You'll need some clothes 
Size 42 
What'll we do about these 
Hmm How did you manage to break them 
On an automobile fan 
That's very bright of you 
Did you hear something 
Where does that lead to 
Just another room 
The way out 
If there's anything I can do 
We sure appreciate that 
Why anyone would have done the same thing 
That's right this war sure makes a difference 
Everybody wants to get in and pitch 
We may want to get a hold of you fast 
Well I can do that when I get back to my uncle 
Okay Miss Martin just keep in touch 
I'm glad we came this way 
I want to take a last look at it 
Beautiful isn't it 
You'll be moving along soon 
Are you carrying any cameras or firearms at all 
Nothing at all Officer 
You sir 
No sir 
They must get a lot of power from this dam 
Did he have the child with him 
His grandchild 
Yes He seemed to be very fond of her 
Evidence of a good heart 
I have children too you know 
Oh 
Two boys Nice little fellows 
Aged two and four 
The four year old is naughty at times 
He's quite a problem 
Do you think it'd be bad for him 
Well I don't know it might be 
When I was a child I had long golden curls 
People used to stop on the street to admire me 
Things are different nowadays 
Ah we're on our way 
Drive to 401 instead of the office 
Okay 
Anything wrong 
Plenty I've just called the office 
They've disconnected the phone 
Same old phone company 
Should have paid the bill 
This is no time for jokes 
The police 
They're watching the office 
The disconnected phone it's our signal 
You think they're watching for me 
I don't know 
Who'd know you were in New York 
Oh yeah 
I guess you're right 
How about Brooklyn tomorrow 
Sorry 
I thought he was in on it 
Shut up 
It's all right 
I'm good at keeping secrets 
Let's go 
Good evening Mr Freeman 
Hi Mr Freeman Hello 
Ah pleased to see you Mr Freeman 
Have a good trip Yes 
Thank you Robert 
Madam is upstairs 
She's waiting anxiously for you 
Oh thank you Robert 
We'll go right up 
This way 
Who's that 
Hey is this a hotel 
What's the festivity 
Idiots all of you 
Stupid inefficient idiots 
Everything is left to me 
I have to hover over all of you like an old hen 
I'm sorry Mrs Sutton 
I will not have my benevolence abused 
My life my position they're important to me 
I'll do my best Mrs Sutton 
I only wish your best were a little better 
Oh 
Mr Freeman I'm glad you've come at this time 
Must you bring him here as well 
I certainly can't furnish him with sanctuary 
This house is full of guests important people 
The police are already watching your office 
Thank goodness they'll never come here 
I'm sorry Mrs Sutton 
We can't leave any loose ends 
All right 
Oh Well I didn't think it was important 
She was just a girl like anybody else 
She picked me up she was pretty 
I guess it was kind of risky 
Well there you are 
I'm so sorry to have exposed you to any risk 
What's she doing here 
You're surprised to see me again 
How did you get here 
It doesn't matter how she got here 
You see Mr Kane 
I will not have my benevolence abused 
So you played smart 
That's great That's a big help to all of us 
No I wasn't smart at all 
I haven't been smart for four days 
Even when I went to the sheriff I hesitated 
You might have at least learned to rattle 
I was right about you in the first place 
Good evening Mr Kane 
I didn't know you were a bookworm 
Let me see 
Here we are 
This will do admirably 
Remarkable work 
Somehow prophetic 
Why are you here Charles 
And what's all this nonsense about books 
I am a refugee 
And whom have I to thank for it 
You Mr Freeman 
The girl was allowed to escape unobserved 
She left Mr Kane went straight to her uncle 
And that charming old man went to the police 
Luckily I was leaving when they arrived 
How appalling 
Your charming house 
I'm so sorry Charles 
It's rather lucky 
You might have been sorrier 
What good is it going to do you to insult me 
We're in trouble now 
Of Mr Kane 
I'm just not sure 
I want to know that he's all right 
All right 
What an understatement 
He's much more than that 
He's noble and fine and pure 
He's misjudged by everyone 
Charles you're joking 
I mean exactly what I say 
Your protégé 
Well you've done splendidly 
You bring him here you idiot 
That's a very appropriate question 
Not much we can do with him 
That's even more impossible at the moment 
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do 
Tooth for a tooth 
Kane for a Tobin 
Please don't discuss things of that sort here 
It's rather nauseating and quite out of place 
Oh Charles I'm frightened 
We must take all precaution 
Of course 
We must also continue with our work 
It's too risky now 
We're already abandoning the dam 
We must remain inactive for a while 
Inactive 
You are utterly mistaken 
Once we do that our organization is finished 
Tomorrow's work 
But Charles the risk 
Is great 
I know that 
I am leaving for the Caribbean now 
Havana will be very gay this season 
The war has made it grim 
It all sounds idyllic 
It's panicky 
I'm deeply sorry 
Am I intruding 
I am so sorry but I just must kidnap Henrietta 
I've had some trouble with these people 
I'll stake my reputation on it 
Don't be a fool 
Get to the house phone 
How'd you get here 
Wait a minute 
No use trying the way I came in 
Let's walk right out through the front door 
Might as well 
Yes sir 
We'll watch the back exit 
They won't get out 
No good 
See the one on the other side 
I met him on the way in 
He's one of them We'll never get out that way 
What can they do to us 
Plenty 
They'd grab us We wouldn't have a chance 
But these people would see them do it 
Barry this is awful 
It's like a bad dream 
Sure there is 
All of them 
Only which one 
Excuse me 
This may sound sort of crazy 
In fact I don't even know how to start 
I'm not being silly 
I assure you Even our hostess Mrs Sutton 
What's the matter with you sir 
You're drunk 
You're not even dressed 
What'd he say 
Oh he thinks I'm drunk 
Beat it out Beat it out 
Keep it natural Eight to the bar 
Yeah man 
Stay in that pitch 
Pardon me 
Did you pay $25 to get in here tonight 
No not exactly 
My boss gave me a ticket 
I need your help very badly 
Are you kidding 
What's the gag 
No I'm on the level 
Aw you're kidding 
Aw sling him your curve 
Beat it out son Beat it out 
What is it Mr Kane 
You know it's hopeless 
I'll show you the way 
They'll grab me as soon as I open my mouth 
What are you gonna do 
We can't just stand here 
I know where we'll be safe 
Barry I'm scared 
Hmm Just a friend of the family 
I guess the room's well sprinkled with them 
They're so smart 
That's what frightens me 
That's the only good part of it I'm with you 
I wish it were somewhere else 
The North Pole I wouldn't care 
Fry 
He seems so small now 
I'd forgotten about him 
So had I 
We can't just wait till they come and get us 
What do you think they'll really do 
Oh Barry please 
Sorry Pat 
The Navy Yard 
One of us has got to get out of here 
Well what about you 
You can't worry about me 
We got to take a chance 
I'll bet you'd look beautiful though 
Afraid we're not behaving very well 
What's the difference 
We weren't invited anyway 
Pat this moment belongs to me 
Oh pardon me 
Do you mind 
Oh excuse me 
Would you care to dance 
Why yes Certainly 
Oh you're really a much better dancer 
Thanks 
Who was the man you were dancing with 
I have no idea 
I never saw him before 
No I mean the man that just left you 
I know 
Oh what a pity 
That was lovely 
I hope you will ask me again 
Oh thanks 
Thanks a lot 
Charming party isn't it 
Where is she 
Would you like to come with me and look for her 
Hold on 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Ladies and gentlemen 
Your attention please 
I have something to tell you 
Mrs Sutton would you kindly step forward 
Thank you 
Mr Kane the young lady is asking to see you 
Are you sure 
I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you sir 
Yes 
Will someone please Admiral how about you 
Would you take over for me please 
Excuse me please 
Delighted sir Thank you 
Ladies and gentlemen 
What am I bid

$1 750 
$2 000 
$2 000 has been bid for this beautiful bracelet 
Where is she 
You've done pretty well here I don't get it 
No you wouldn't 
People that plod along without asking questions 
The great masses the moron millions 
They get things done 
Yeah 
They get things done 
That's why I'm leaving now 
Perhaps I can get what I want then power 
We all have different tastes as you can see 
You certainly make it sound smooth and easy 
Well that's a trick 
I know the results of that power you believe in 
That's what you're aiming at 
But it doesn't bother you I can see that 
Because you really hate all people 
Let me tell you something 
The last four five days I've learned a lot

If there's nothing more for the moment sir 
Good day sir Good day

The telegram Oh You had it at the hall 
Be a good Samaritan and come with me won't you 
Come on be a dear 
Another game 
No thanks I've had enough 
How much do we owe 
This lady's lost a telegram 
Anyone seen such a thing 
A telegram 
Has it been opened 
It wasn't in an envelope just the form 
It was addressed Fraser and signed Maud 
I can't think what on earth I could have 
Why I believe that's it 
It is thank goodness for that 
Oh but what about your game 
You'll need it for the score 
We'd just finished 
Oh that's all right then 
Bit of a makeshift in here 
Not very comfy for you is it 
No 
Oh well I'll be getting along then 
There you are Thank you so much 
Up to our necks in it weren't we Maxwell 
Power I suppose 
There's something in that 
You don't think it's a genuine possibility 
Oh Mrs Fraser it arrived this morning 
You've every right to be angry 
Coffee in ten minutes Bridget 
No there's no answer 
What are all those figures 
Oh it's the soldiers I left it at the hall 
The continental way 
Yes the seven for example 
What an extraordinary thing 
I don't see anything extraordinary about it 
Yes but would they be in the Royal Engineers 
Goodness makes you think 
I don't agree with you 
You never do my dear 
What was the man like 
The one who was scoring 
Did he say anything to you 
No just like that 
Manners I thought to meself at the time 
A spy who can't understand English 
No No that's absurd of course 
Well I don' t know what to think 
The one that went for young George this morning 
Made a proper laughingstock of meself didn't I 
And quite as ridiculous 
We will 
Please yourself my dear 
That was certainly a good one Wilsford

I'll get on to Zone Headquarters at once 
Wait a minute what a fool I am

I feel so stupid so useless 
We've only got a minute 
No not a miracle a chance A sporting chance 
That's right Do exactly what he tells us

It's my grandmother's recipe book 
Rationing wasn't in it

They were reduced to the most terrible straits 
Rats were quite a delicacy apparently 
Look elephant cutlets Good heavens 
Oh yes they ate all the animals from the zoo 
Parrot pie Roast leg of bear 
Antelope steak Tiger en casserole 
I believe hyena was too much for her though 
She was ill for weeks afterwards 
Hyena 
I can quite imagine that was no laughing matter 
Do borrow it then won't you Oh may I 
I'll take the greatest care of it 
Oh don't bother to come and see me off 
By the bye I do hope your side wins 
My side

Duck Not again 
Well George got to Upton all right 
Get down 
Yes that's the only bit of England they got 
On Monday night Hitler tried his invasion 
You know how that went up in smoke 
Lubinski Kubinski 
Lominski Rozanski and Poznanski 
We're in Warsaw the capital of Poland 
It's August 1939 
Europe is still at peace 
But suddenly something seems to have happened 
Are those Poles seeing a ghost 
Why does this car suddenly stop 
Everybody seems to be staring in one direction 
Can it be true It must be true 
No doubt 
The man with the little mustache Adolf Hitler 
That's impossible He's a vegetarian 
And yet he doesn't always stick to his diet 
Sometimes he swallows whole countries 
Does he want to eat up Poland too 
Anyhow how did he get here 
What happened 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Colonel we have Wilhelm Coetze here 
If you'd like to look into his record 
I hope he'll talk He'd better 
Send him in 
Yes sir 
Wilhelm Coetze 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Sure our Führer 
Sure 
He doesn't like him now does he 
And Hitler's going to end up as 
A piece of cheese 
Yes 
Yeah How did you know 
Well it's a natural thought 
A natural thought 
You see Colonel I hope you don't doubt my 
Heil Hitler 
The Führer 
Heil Hitler 
Heil myself 
That's not in the script 
But Mr Dobosh please 
That's not in the script Mr Bronski 
But it'll get a laugh 
I want 
You want my opinion Mr Dobosh 
No I don't want your opinion 
What does the script say 
I make an entrance 
And what do you say 
Nothing 
Then say nothing 
Mr Rawitch what you are I wouldn't eat 
How dare you call me a ham 
Folks I want everybody to understand this 
This is a serious play a realistic drama 
Good morning Dobosh 
Good morning 
How do you like my dress 
Very good 
Don't you think it's pretty 
That's it Well why not 
I think it's a tremendous contrast 
Think of me being flogged in the darkness 
That's a terrific laugh 
That's right Greenberg 
You must be out of your mind 
I'm sorry I lost my temper 
Sweetheart the dress stinks 
I afraid 
Why should I be Of course not 
You're the best actor in the world 
Everybody knows that even you 
Don't be a prima donna 
Whenever I start a story you finish it 
I'm satisfied to be the father 
Who made you up 
I did Mr Dobosh 
What's wrong with it 
I don't know It's not convincing 
To me he's just a man with a little mustache 
But so was Hitler 
Wait it's not just the mustache 
I can 
I know 
That picture That's what he should look like 
But that picture was taken of me 
Then the picture's wrong too 
May I have your autograph Mr Bronski 
Bronski Why certainly 
I know it would get a laugh 
I thought that was the real start of my career 
The Rialto scene 
It's me Have I not eyes 
have I not hands 
subject to the same diseases 
If you prick us do we not bleed 
if you tickle us do we not laugh 
if you poison us do we not die 
You'd move them to tears 
Instead I have to carry a spear 
That's all we do carry a spear 
Would get a terrific laugh 
Hello this is Mr Tura 
Right away please Thank you 
The audience is a little cool tonight 
Not to me 
I know I'm giving a rotten performance 
You faker 
Darling you were right this morning 
Did you darling 
That's sweet of you 
But I really don't care 
But darling you know how I feel about you 
Why I'd even 
Flowers 
Aren't they beautiful 
There was no card 
No card again 
That's three nights in succession Who is he 
This man probably loves theater an art fanatic 
Three nights in a row 
You forget you're playing Hamlet 
That's right 
Mr Tura on stage 
Maria darling I'm going into my big scene 
Thanks darling 
It's true Anna I don't know who it is 
But I'm positive who it might be 
You mean that young aviator 
Yes he's very young 
Like the little thing in the second row 
Waiting for an answer 
Is he suffering very much 
Yes he had to break his silence 
He couldn't bear it any longer 
No he couldn't 
Poor little thing He's just a mere boy 
Oh no What's he want you to do adopt him 
Of course I won't Definitely not 
Yet I don't like to be rude to him 
Darling don't waste any more time with excuses 
Yes I think I owe it to my public 
Dear Lieutenant 
Wait till you see him Anna 
Unfortunately my time is completely taken up 
How does it sound Safe 
O heavy burden 
I hear him coming Let's withdraw my lord 
To be or not to be: 
that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
Or to take arms 
Thank you Mrs Tura for receiving me 
And now you're probably disappointed 
Mrs Tura 
Please sit down Thank you 
And now I see you 
Some people thought I was funny 
Of poor little me 
I wouldn't hurt a fly 
Or a goldfish 
By the way how is he Who 
The goldfish 
What goldfish 
The one you're so attached to 
You see I read all your interviews 
Oh yes of course 
By the way where was that 
In The Chronicle 
No I mean where is the farm 
No I think we've talked much too much about me 
Tell me about yourself 
There isn't much to tell I just fly a bomber 
How perfectly thrilling 
Really 
Does that interest you 
It certainly does 
Would you permit me to show you my plane 
Maybe 
When shall I call for you 
Tomorrow at 2:00 at my home 
No I'd better meet you right at the airport 
Goodbye 
Bye 
Tomorrow at 2:00 I'm gonna look down on Warsaw 
He's gonna take me up 10 000 feet in the air 
There's nothing wrong in that is there 
It happened 
What every actor dreads 
What darling 
Someone walked out on me 
Tell me Maria am I losing my grip 
Of course not darling I'm so sorry 
But he walked out on me 
Maybe he had a sudden heart attack 
I hope so 
If he stayed he might have died 
What's going on 
Hitler's speaking to the Reichstag 
How do you do Mr Dobosh 
How do you do Doctor 
This is Dr Voyawski from the Foreign Office 
How do you do gentlemen 
I'm afraid I have some bad news for you 
You mean we cannot open tonight 
I'm afraid that's what it comes down to 
But why 
We all have a right to know 
I know the play has artistic value 
It has much more than that 
That's exactly what the government is afraid of 
It might offend Hitler 
Do you ever listen to him 
I'm sorry gentlemen but the order is final 
To be or not to be: 
that is the question: 
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune 
Anna I'd like to speak to Mrs Tura alone 
It was a very sympathetic look I thought 
I had the feeling you like me Was I wrong 
No not at all Stanislav 
Tell me Maria Be frank You still like me 
Well of course 
You still like me huh 
You think you'll always like me 
I don't see any reason why not 
What 
We must tell him of course 
Tell him what 
He has no right to stand in our way 
Dobosh Where does he come in 
You don't want to stay on the stage 
I wouldn't let you You're tired of it anyway 
I'll build a swimming pool for your goldfish 
That's why I must talk to your husband 
But I love my husband 
No you don't 
I'll wait here for him 
Stanislav you must listen to me 
Mrs Tura 
Stay out Anna 
Mrs Tura it's war 
Without any declaration of war 
Without a word of warning 
It's really war 
Goodbye Maria 
Stanislav come back 
I have to 
I have to see you again 
Maria have you heard 
Yes it's war 
It seems impossible It's incredible 
Does the audience know 
No I have to tell them 
It's a conspiracy A foul conspiracy 
It's worse than that It's a crime 
What are you talking about 
Don't you understand It's war 
It's an air alarm 
There's no censor to stop them 
Unhappy Poland 
Warsaw destroyed for the sake of destruction 
The curtain had fallen on the Polish drama: 
a tragedy with no relief in sight 
There was no censor to stop them 
If you prick us do we not bleed 
if you tickle us do we not laugh 
if you poison us do we not die 
All I had to do was to carry a spear 
I wonder if we'll ever carry a spear again 
Let's hope so 
The battle was on V 
Down with Hitler 
We are even much funnier over Berlin 
When do we hear you again Professor Siletsky 
I'm afraid it might be quite some time Why 
What's the matter 
You are going on a secret mission Professor 
He's going to Berlin to call on Hitler 
I'm sorry that I even mentioned it 
But you didn't 
We got it out of you 
And I know it will be buried right here Warsaw 
If she's still alive 
I only wish it were possible for me to find out 
Could you find out please My mother 
I understand exactly how you feel 
But you must realize 
Professor Siletsky Yes 
A lady Yes 
It's a very confidential matter 
I'd appreciate it if you'd tell her 
But don't tell her husband 
I know exactly what to tell her 
Just say To be or not to be She knows 
A code message 
What's the name of the lady 
It's Maria Tura Just a moment 
I'll write it down 
What did you say the name was 
Is that correct 
Don't tell me you've never heard of Maria Tura 
Should I 
Well you lived in Warsaw 
Well known 
She's famous Yes indeed 
Here it's the name of my brother 
I don't know if you can read the writing 
All right 
Lieutenant 
How do you do sir Gen Armstrong 
Major Cunningham 
How do you do 
You see sir the other night 
Neither have I 
She's the most famous actress in Warsaw 
There's only one actress I ever heard of 
He left already didn't he 
Yes he was due in Sweden yesterday 
Told you what 
That he was going to Warsaw 
That seems incredible 
Of the relatives in Warsaw 
He took them 
Yes sir 
How could he do such a thing 
When does Professor Siletsky get to Warsaw 
He probably took the boat today for Lithuania 
How long will it take you to fly to Warsaw 
About six or seven hours sir 
You mind waiting outside a minute 
Yes sir 
I hate to believe it So do I sir 
We can't take any chances 
And we checked again and again sir 
We're not condemning him 
Of course he may be just a fool 
He's no fool 
Well sir what are your orders 
Call in the young man Yes sir 
Yes sir 
Ten minutes 
All right 
Halt 
Too bad we missed him 
Good evening 
Good evening 
Have you by any chance Anna Karenina by Tolstoy 
I think I have 
Yes

Eight zloty 75 
Goodbye gentlemen

Good evening Mrs Tura 
Good evening 
It's a great pleasure to meet you Mrs Tura 
Won't you sit down 
Cigarette Thank you 
It's rather flattering That's very well put 
There's a charming young man in England 
To be or not to be 
You no doubt know its deeper meaning 
Yes I have a vague idea 
I really Will you forgive me please 
Hello Yes 
How do you do Colonel Ehrhardt 
Otherwise 
Whenever you wish of course 
Very well 
I'm looking forward to making your acquaintance 
Goodbye Colonel I'm sorry 
Well I won't keep you any longer 
Thank you for the charming message 
Mrs Tura you're an actress aren't you 
Yes 
Very 
The right side 
What is the right side 
The winning side 
I don't quite understand 
Now come that's rather a crude word 
It was really an exciting part 
Wouldn't it be exciting to play it in real life 
For instance invite certain people 
I assure you that can be very easily remedied 
Well what do you say 
But what are we going to do about my conscience 
I have a slight idea 
We're not brutal we're not monsters 
Tell me do I look like a monster 
Of course not Professor 
We're just like other people 
We're human And sometimes 
very human 
I'm convinced of that 
Why don't you stay here for dinner 
I can imagine nothing more charming 
Au revoir 
Just a moment 
I'm looking forward to it 
So am I 
This lady is permitted to leave Yes sir 
Bye 
To be or not to be 
I'm feeling much better 
I'm glad at that Who are you 
How did you get here 
Parachute 
I jumped from a plane 
Your wife 
Isn't she back I'm getting worried 
You're worried 
I'm worried 
Not so loud you might endanger all of us 
After all we're all in the same boat 
Oh the same boat 
What ill wind blew you into my slippers 
What 
At the Hotel Europe 
Soldiers everywhere Does he know I'm here 
No but he wants me to become a Nazi spy 
Who is Siletsky 
A spy 
And who is he 
Lieutenant Sobinski 
What are you doing here 
What does that matter 
Don't you understand Siletsky's here 
It's unbelievable 
But Mr Tura this is zero hour 
Is that clear No 
You're going to have dinner with him 
So do I 
This is an emergency 
Look 
A catastrophe He must be taken care of 
And he will be taken care of 
Who's going to do it I'm going to do it 
But how Where 
except for the next few hours 
Thank you Professor 
Yes on the winning side 
It's nice being here Professor 
I ordered a buffet 
After all this isn't a fair State 
Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg 
I prefer a slow encirclement 
You shouldn't be 
Why don't you find out 
I will 
I'm taking an awful chance 
You're a very determined man 
Yes very 
But you have great charm yes 
I only hope you live up to that Y Professor 
You'll see

Yes but I'll make it as quickly as possible 
That's terrible 
I won't be long 
I'm so sorry 
Well it can't be helped 
Just a moment

Yes sir

It's a pleasure to meet you Professor 
A very great pleasure 
You certainly fooled the English didn't you 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
How did he ever become a general 
He's Göring's brother in law 
I'll announce you to the Colonel Thank you 
He brought the papers with him 
Now remember Who were his helpers in England 
Tura you're playing for our lives 
I'm going to do the impossible 
I'm going to surpass myself Don't

Professor please Thank you 
Heil Hitler Heil Hitler 
Professor Siletsky I'm glad to see you 
Thank you very much 
Let's see this 
Excellent 
They're as good as dead 
No that covers everything 
Good 
The duplicate 
Yes of course the duplicate 
You know Professor 
Warsaw is a dangerous place these days 
Yes of course Naturally 
Very well 
All right I'll get this wrapped up No 
He still has papers in his trunk 
Papers in his trunk 
I'll kill that dirty dog any how 
How are we going to get into his hotel 
Get back there and keep him there 
We'll try to figure something out 
Sit down Professor 
There are many things I want to ask you 
So many things 
So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
Yes 
That's the way it is 
But it will crystallize 
Maybe there's something you like to ask me 
No I can't think of anything Colonel 
So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
Well 
Excuse me a minute I'll be right back 
I'm running out of dialogue 
We got it 
Put this gun in your pocket 
Take him to the hotel 
All right 
Just a minute 
What'll happen to me 
They'll kill me 
We're going to keep our fingers crossed 
Good Wait a minute 
Relax 
Oh Mrs Tura 
Tell me how is Mrs Tura 
Sit down Professor 
And besides that she's very good company 
Very good company 
Well thank you 
Maybe you'll even put in a good word for me 
I'd be delighted 
Well thank you 
Tell me hasn't she a husband 
Yes but what does it matter 
Yes what does it 
Of course you've heard of him 
No I haven't 
You didn't 
Then how did you get in touch with her 
It's rather a delicate story 
Asked me to deliver a message to her 
That gives you a rough idea of the message 
Yes It is a little rough 
Seems they have a secret love code 
Am I boring you 
No I find it very interesting 
But Mrs Tura seemed to understand it perfectly 
Well what was the message 
To be or not to be 
To be 
To be or not to be 
And when I say enemy I mean enemy 
You think they had a romance 
No 
I guess you're right Professor 
And so do I 
So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
Coming back to Mrs Tura 
Let's forget about her 
I think I know what you mean 
Then I don't have to say it do I 
Why No not at all 
That great Polish actor Joseph Tura 
Well that's none of my concern 
But it should be Mr Tura 
Raise your hands quickly please 
Did you ever play a corpse Mr Tura 
What 
I won't do it 
Turn around 
Get over there and face that wall 
Now stay there 
Sure you won't change your mind 
I'll give you one more chance 
Farewell Mr Tura 
Long live Poland 
What happened 
I don't know he must have gone out 
There he is Get him 
Get backstage Raise the curtain 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Professor Siletsky 
Professor Siletsky isn't here 
You expect him back 
Yes certainly 
Do you mind if I wait here for the Professor 
No not at all 
Thank you 
Good night 
Good night Professor Good night 
Professor Siletsky 
Yes 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
I'm Capt Schultz of Colonel Ehrhardt's staff 
Well I'm glad to meet you Captain 
Mrs Tura 
I thought you had left Madame 
And how is Professor Siletsky 
Dead 
Absolutely dead 
I had to take care of some business 
How about a glass of champagne No thank you 
I don't drink Cigarette 
Thank you 
I don't smoke 
Just like our Führer Yes 
I admit I was a little surprised when I came in 
And I don't blame you 
You didn't know Madame before 
Well no 
Not exactly 
But the explanation is very simple 
Isn't that right 
Yes 
Yes But he's no particular friend of mine 
Nevertheless a friend It was a code message 
Code message 
You've probably heard of him 
No I haven't 
Professor Colonel Ehrhardt Yes 
There has been a change in the Colonel's plans 
You're not going to take him away I'm sorry 
But the Colonel is expecting the Professor now 
Those are my orders 
Well it looks like I'll have to go 
Excuse me a moment 
Sweetheart 
Darling 
What did you do with Sobinski 
Yes the scene is loaded with dynamite 
One little slip and I'm a dead man 
Maria be honest be frank 
Sweetheart darling I love you 
Don't you know that 
Don't you feel it 
If anything happened to you 
You think I can do it You're a great actor 
Nobody can play it but you 
You can and you will do it Goodbye darling 
Goodbye 
But if I come back it's a different matter 
Yes 
Heil Hitler Heil Hitler 
Professor Siletsky is here 
Have him come in 
Why not 
You have no proof 
Now that's a fine excuse 
Arrest him too 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Professor at last we meet 
Colonel Ehrhardt 
No thank you 
There was a sudden change in my schedule 
Confidentially big news 
Who wouldn't 
That's right 
How long since you've seen him Professor 
Too long Much too long 
Of course 
Yes I think I can say that without any risk 
London 
Oh yes London 
Colonel you're quiet famous in London 
You know what they call you 
Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
They do do they 
So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
I thought you would react just that way 
Well Professor let's have your information 
Certainly Brandy 
A story about our Führer 
Now how does it go Yes 
They named a brandy after Napoleon 
They made a herring out of Bismarck 
Don't you think it's funny 
No Neither would the Führer 
After all I'll never 
Please don't misunderstand me 
See I'm loyal Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Why should I ruin you 
Of course that's very nice 
My word of honor Thank you 
What exactly are your plans 
You want to know 
Yes if you don't mind 
It's better having the lock than the key 
How does it sound Promising Most promising 
But tell me what exactly do you intend to do 
Well let's get down to details 
Yes if you please 
There are no details 
At least not yet The important thing is 
If we play our cards right and carefully 
I understand 
What's the name of the shepherd 
Boguslaw Revanski 
Send Capt Schultz in 
So they call me Concentration Camp Ehrhardt 
Capt Schultz there's a man in this town 
Yes 
You don't have to worry about him 
What 
Don't you realize whom you shot Capt Schultz 
It's sabotage 
I resent that Professor 
Why did you shoot him 
That's no reason to shoot him 
I agree with you 
At least not right away 
I sign so many every day 
I can't rely on my own people anymore 
Maximilian Pietrowski 
Maximilian Pietrowski Don't tell me you 
Yes 
It can't be done 
I resent that Professor 
That's all Schultz 
Yes sir 
You mean our Führer 
No please Professor 
Hope you won't 
Why should I ruin you again 
Thank you so much 
London 
Yes certainly 
When did you plan to leave 
I'd like to get out as soon as possible 
Under the circumstances that's best 
Two My trip was successful in one respect 
I made a discovery A certain Mrs Tura 
Frankly I don't believe in women agents 
You'll change your mind if you meet her 
Why don't you 
Form your own opinion If you say no it's no 
Mrs Tura 
You've probably heard of him 
Really 
Goodbye Colonel 
Goodbye Professor 
I'm Colonel Ehrhardt 
Will you sit down please 
Mrs Tura I sent for you 
I'm very grateful 
Mrs Tura I have bad news for you 
No Mrs Tura It isn't that 
Dead 
Murdered 
I can't believe it 
It can't be 
When did this happen 
Was it at the hotel 
No He was evidently trapped somewhere 
The Führer has just arrived in Warsaw 
A performance by the soldiers 
Who could have done such a thing 
Have you any idea 
So the only mystery left is where is this man 
Believe me we're going to get him 
I hope so 
My poor Professor 
Goodbye 
You might be very valuable to us 
Thank you 
Colonel whatever you decide if you want me 
That is my duty and if I may say my pleasure 
It doesn't have to be today 
Why don't you let me know 
I'll try not to 
That's the spirit 
Mrs Tura seems to be rather upset 
After all he died for the Führer 
Naturally 
Hello 
Good morning Professor Siletsky I have 
You will be a little late 
Yes I understand 
The Professor left quite a while ago 
He did Thank you 
Was Tura here Yeah 
Did he say anything 
Dobosh you know what happened 
Yes It's all right Joseph just left 
What do you mean 
He's lost 
They found the body in the theater 
They know everything 
What Who opened the theater 
The Nazis 
Who gave them the key 
You idiot you shut up 
The Professor is here 
We will be delighted 
Professor please 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler How is the Professor 
Fine thank you How is the Colonel 
Excellent May I 
Wonderful 
I'm glad you feel that way 
Yes indeed 
How do you do 
It's a pleasure 
Would you mind stepping into my living room 
He should have cracked by now 
Then we try a little physical culture 
Did you get bored 
No Really 
Let's go and see 
It looks like murder 
If I'm wrong Colonel please correct me 
Has that struck you too 
Definitely 
Now that you mention it I think you're right 
Please forgive me 
Certainly 
You mind if I play detective 
Thank you 
Edmondson's London 
You think it looks bad for me 
Terrible 
His watch is still running 
There's a distinct possibility 
There's no doubt there was a definite purpose 
He wanted to look like me 
Or you wanted to look like him 
That's right 
Not similar Exactly alike 
How long did you know each other 
You must have observed him for months 
It takes that long to grow a beard of that kind 
Very good Schultz 
Excellent Schultz 
Very funny 
No Professor I'll tell you a better story 
Maybe he is wearing a false beard 
I hardly think so 
Why don't you convince yourself 
Why don't you pull his beard 
I can't do it 
No you can't 
Too sensitive 
I can't believe it 
You gave the order yourself 
Shifting the responsibility on me again 
That's all Schultz Bye bye gentlemen 
Professor I don't know how to apologize 
You were only doing your duty 
Please Professor 
Come on Just once Don't rub it in 
And Professor if you see the Führer 
Thank you so much 
With Mrs Tura 
Of course Anything you say Professor 
Get me the airport 
Where's Colonel Ehrhardt's office 
Heil Hitler 
Colonel Ehrhardt 
Yes sir 
I'm in charge of the Führer's Safety Squad 
Can't I rely on anyone 
But General 
Arrest this man 
No General 
This man's an imposter 
Are you crazy 
He is Professor Siletsky 
What do you have to say for yourself now 
And furthermore 
Yes You'll hear from me 
Take him out 
Piece of cheese 
Schultz 
I hope it's true 
But it isn't 
We'll talk about that later 
Friends 
Just a moment 
It was a flop 
The situation is very similar 
If we can get them away for just one second 
No we can't use you There'll be no ladies 
Greenberg 
Yes Mr Dobosh 
It'll get a terrific laugh 
No it won't 
What do I have to do Mr Dobosh 
If you don't play it right we're all lost 
What do I have to do 
All right let's rehearse 
How does it look 
Excellent 
I'm ready 
Let's see 
Looks all right 
Yes He looks very good 
I'll pick you up about 9:00 
Oh darling 
Goodbye 
Goodbye darling 
I guess you want to say goodbye Go ahead 
This may be the last time we'll see each other 
Goodbye Mrs Tura 
Goodbye Mr Sobinski 
Heil the Führer 
Heil 
How did you get here 
I was born here 
What made you decide to die here 
Him 
What do you want from the Führer 
What does he want from us 
What does he want from Poland 
Why all this Why 
Aren't we human 
Have we not eyes Have we not hands 
If you prick us do we not bleed 
if you tickle us do we not laugh 
if you poison us do we not die 
if you wrong us shall we not revenge 
Lieutenants Lange and Schneider 
Who's in charge here 
I am sir 
How could this have happened 
I don't know sir 
To the airport 
We have to make a stop on the way 
I'll tell you where 
And he got his chance at last 
And he'll play it again 
The railroad station 
The underground is still alive 
Yes We saved the underground 
Bronski now we belong to history 
They might even erect a monument to us 
They will 
Yes and sometimes when 
What's the matter 
Nothing 
I am such a nervous wreck I'm imagining things 
Imagining what 
I thought you were wearing a mustache 
I am 
No you're not 
Are you crazy 
What did you do with it 
My mustache We got to find it 
Good evening Mrs Tura 
I suppose you're surprised to see us 
We have several things we want to find out 
It is very urgent 
The Colonel and I were talking things over 
Thank you But what's so very urgent about that 
attracted to Professor Siletsky 
You never can tell about those things 
For instance you're attractive yourself 
Perhaps my taste is a little peculiar 
That's what fascinated you so much 
I always felt like pulling it but I didn't 
What do you mean by that 
It was a false beard you know that 
How do you know all this 
Gen Von Seidelman 
What do you know about him 
He thanked me for the information and 
Gentlemen do you by any chance suspect me 
Mrs Tura 
General thought everything was all right 
What are you trying to get me into now 
Colonel it was your own idea 
Shifting the responsibility on me again 
Good night Schultz 
Good night Colonel 
This Schultz Oh Mrs Tura I'm so sorry 
I'll drive you there 
You don't understand Someone is coming 
Someone is coming here 
If he should find you 
Colonel I'm a married woman 
But you're expecting someone 
Now I have to stay here 
Colonel I have to protect your husband 
No Colonel you mustn't do this 
I don't want a bracelet 
I can make life worth living for you 
I don't want any eggs Colonel please go 
Maria 
Why didn't you tell me 
How could I Don't you understand 
Haven't you any tact 
My Führer 
Schultz 
The Lieutenant will take the control 
Yes mein Führer 
Jump 
Heil Hitler 
Heil Hitler 
Two very obliging fellows 
Now let's go to England 
First it was Hess now it's him 
Everybody a nice smile Thank you 
And you Mr Tura 
You played the real hero in this amazing play 
Thank you my friends for everything you did 
As little as it may have been 
What do you desire most Mr Tura 
Well I He wants to play Hamlet 
He wants to play Hamlet 
Than is my deed to my most painted word 
O heavy burden 
I hear him coming 
Let's withdraw my Lord 
To be or not to be 
Fifty years ago 
She was poor 
She was beautiful 
To go out alone into space 
Go out alone 
To catch a star in your fingertips 
But this you can share with them 
Aware that the 
What what's that 
You are feeling better 
Sit still a moment 
You fainted 
I 
I'm sorry I interrupted the lecture so stupidly 
You can get the notes from some other students 
Your name is Marie Scholoscka 
Yes 
You are working in two master degrees 
One in physics and one in mathematics 
What did you have to eat today 
Eat 
Yes eat 
I don't remember 
I have some lunch 
What did you have 
Salmon 
All sort of things 
You have a pleasant room 
Yes monsieur 
Good 
What time did you have that coat 
Come along 
Come along please 
I have little time for friends 
Usually there's some young men 
I'm interested in physics and mathematics 
Yes so am I 
I'm afraid I will not be up to that 
Your desire is to go back to Poland and teach 
Yes 
Your parents are still in Warsaw 
My father is a physics professor He is old 
You love Poland 
Oh yes 
I love Poland 
Physics and mathematics and Poland 
Yes 
Eat your soup 
Thank you very much 
I would be glad to recommend you if you wish 
There would be some cumbersome costs 
I don't know exactly what 
Oh it wouldn't matter 
Really it wouldn't 
I would be so grateful 
Perhaps he might have recommendation available 
Come and have tea Sunday with my wife and me 
I will ask him to come too 
You probably know his name 
It is Pierre Curie 
Oh thank you so much 
Thank you 
You have been very kind 
Not at all 
Not at all 
Good bye then 
Until Sunday 
Sunday 
Good night 
Good night 
To catch a star at your fingertips 
Ah 
Madame Poirot 
You are Mdme 
I knew it 
Yes 
We've been waiting for you 
My husband has told me all about you 
Ah 
Professor Curie 
How nice 
Madame 
You two had met 
Have not had the honor in the hallway 
Marie Scholoscka 
professor Pierre Curie 
We must remedy that 
Please Professor 
Come in Come in 
I'm sure you know everyone here 
In Paris you must have many friends 
I want you to meet all these charming 
May I introduce you to 
What time 
Always hard to meet gentlemen 
Dr Curie 
Good afternoon 
I had no idea that it was going to be a party 
No 
I believe you monsieur 
Well I 
I'm very bad at parties 
It's impossible for me to focus 
My mind won't follow the most simple thought 
Oh I beg your pardon 
You are quite alright 
Maybe I'll come back some other day 
No 
Of course 
Of course 
I believe extremely talented 
Oh I should be very glad 
In that case 
However my workroom is quite large 
I have shared it with students before 
You have 
He used to whistle constantly 
Then I should be very happy 
I think you will find that she is very sincere 
She 
Oh my God 
These are my granddaughters 
Excuse me 
But 
Mademoiselle 
Mademoiselle 
Bon Appetit 
A coffee 
Yes thank you 
Tea 
That's coffee 
That's coffee too 
Oh 
Please sit down everybody 
Sit down 
Wait a moment 
Come along children 
It's time for your performance 
Would you excuse them Dr Curie 
They are going to play the piano 
Come along 
There they are 
This is the student of whom we were speaking 
Dr Pierre Curie 
We have already met 
I am very grateful 
Of course I have no idea that is 
Would you sit down Madame 
Oh would you please excuse me 
I feel my grandchildren are about to entertain 
Would you care for tea 
Thank you 
I've just had some 
It's coffee 
Playing incredibly badly don't you think 
Very badly Dr Curie 
Of course I'm no judge 
Oh good morning Dr Curie 
Good morning David 
I have the sulphates all ready for you 
Thank you 
No one has arrived yet 
Here at the laboratory 
No sir 
Are you expecting someone 
Yes sir 
Her name is Marie Sc 
Funny I was introduced to her twice 
She's a girl 
I didn't find out in time 
Yes sir 
I find sir 
Women's love in life is the living of it 
She's a natural enemy of science 
There's no doubt of it sir 
Woman and science are incompatible 
Woman of genius are rare 
No true scientist can have anything with women 
No sir 
Yes sir 
I do hope she doesn't whistle 
Oh David 
She'll need one for her experiments 
Oh yes 
I 
I'm very sorry sir 
I beg your pardon are you looking for something 
Yes 
I'm looking for Dr Curie's laboratory 
You're here 
But you're not 
I mean you can't be 
Excuse me please 
No You don't understand 
You see I'm Dr Curie's assistant 
Oh then you can direct me 
Oh I certainly can 
Certainly can 
Oh just this way 
Thank you 
What do you think of that 
I run into you the first thing 
Oh here we are 
Here she is Dr Curie 
Run straight into her the first day 
Oh 
Good morning Mademoiselle 
Good morning Dr Curie 
Yes 
Well that's just as it should be 
People interested in work should be left alone 
You have met my assistant 
Yes 
I don't think I quite caught his name 
David 
David Lagroue 
Thank you Dr Curie 
I appreciate this chance more than I can say 
Over this way 
How do you think this is going to suit you 
Oh 
It is excellent 
Yes 
I've studied with him too 
Wonderful isn't he 
Yes he is 
Oh I'll give you a little more light 
Please don't bother 
Oh Dr Curie wants you to be comfortable 
I'm sorry Dr Curie 
Here's a paper and pencil 
Oh I can take my coat off 
Oh 
It's always the way you should 
Your hat 
I'll hide it up at the cupboard for you 
I'm sorry Dr Curie 
Let me help you 
Thank you 
You know my office is just upstairs 
You're very kind 
You sure everything's alright 
Quite 
Thank you 
Not at all 
I'd be glad to explain it to you 
There's a very nice little restaurant down 
Really monsieur 
I don't think we should talk 
Why are you whispering 
I just think you ought to know where to go 
Yes but I 
I'll take you there later 
That's the best way and 
It's too trouble 
Oh no trouble at all 
I'll come back for you 
Good evening Mademoiselle 
Good evening Dr Curie 
Miserable evening hasn't it 
Yes isn't it 
Oh yes 
Thank you very much 
He finally look into it 
Good 
Well good evening 
But you have no umbrella Mademoiselle 
No I haven't Dr Curie 
I'm sorry 
I didn't realize 
Perhaps I can help you 
Oh I don't want to trouble you 
Allow me 
No trouble at all 
No trouble at all 
Thank you 
You're very kind 
Not at all Mademoiselle 
May I ask you another question 
Dr Curie in the same connection 
It's a simple matter perhaps but it puzzles me 
Yes Mademoiselle 
Yes 
For final case I guess 
I don't see why it's quite straightforward 
Well if you consider the matter rigorously 
Hmm 
I have to look into that 
This is where I lived 
Good bye and thank you 
Of course 
Oh good bye mademoiselle 
And may I say your conversation is very simplely 
Thank you 
It's an extremely dawning hypothesis 
Good morning Mademoiselle 
Good morning Dr Curie 
I'm a little late this morning 
I have to stop in at my publishers 
Oh 
My book 
Oh it's lovely 
One of the first copy just off the press 
On semitry and physical phenomena 
That's something to be proud of 
I thought perhaps you might like a copy 
Oh I would very much 
Well it's yours 
It's yours Mademoiselle 
Oh thank you 
Not at all 
I believe that's the usual procedure 
I'm very flattered 
Not at all 
Come in Oh Dr Becquerel 
I hope I'm not intruding Dr Curie 
But could you step over my laboratory with me 
Why 
What is it 
Are you too busy to 
Oh no 
Not at all 
I'll come at once 
Oh aren't you coming Mademoiselle 
Well if I may 
You don't mind 
No No I'll be delighted 
I came upon it quite by accident 
What is this thing 
Well what did you see 
You have taken the picture of a key apparently 
Yes the picture of a key 
But how was that possible 
Some months ago 
So I make some photographic experiments 
I see 
And your experiment was a success 
See there they are 
They're all black every one of them 
Then how did you explain 
Now look at this one please 
That has been exposed am I right 
Light has reached 
Oh yes 
That has been exposed 
I didn't even know it was there 
I discovered it yesterday 
Half hour ago I developed the plate 
This is the result 
That Monsieur must be so 
Incredible 
It is incredible 
Strange 
Very strange 
What could it be 
What could be the nature of radiation 
What could be the origin of it 
Perhaps we shall never know 
Not at all 
Dr Curie 
You finished that already 
Why 
What do you mean 
So soon 
I haven't realized 
Yes 
I have been here six months 
It's the middle of June 
The term is nearly over 
How fast it goes 
Yes 
So nice to be walking in the country 
My father loves to walk 
Your father 
Is he here in Paris 
Oh no 
Warsaw 
But you're not thinking going to Warsaw 
Of course 
But when 
As soon as I finished my examinations 
But for how long 
Why for 
Why Dr Curie 
You forget that if I passed my examinations 
I'm going back to Poland to teach 
Well I knew that 
You are making experiments of your own 
I know it 
I shall miss Paris too 
But this is absurd fantastic 
Why it never occurred to me 
Oh I 
I haven't planned on this at all 
My father is getting old 
He misses me 
Anyone can teach but you can do more much more 
Oh Mademoiselle 
I beg you to reconsider 
Why that's very kind of you Dr Curie 
I'm really flattered 
I thought of course you knew 
I know 
Dr Curie 
Yes Mademoiselle 
I've been meaning to ask you 
Of course 
I understand perfectly 
I feel exactly the same way myself 
Good bye Dr Curie 
Good bye Mademoiselle 
We may well expect to hear again and again 
Above all it's the mother of learning 
Pride is not deflated by what they take away 
For the degree the master of physics 
First 
Marie Scholoscka 
Hello Dr Curie 
Oh hello David 
Isn't she wonderful 
First place in physics 
Yes 
It's very gratifying 
Here she was bright 
Scholoscka have you David 
Yes I saw her 
Had a nice talk with her 
Congratulated her and everything 
She went straight home 
Had some packing to do 
Packing 
Well she's leaving for Poland on Tuesday 
Oh 
Good bye Dr Curie 
Oh 
Awfully glad I run into you 
Good bye David 
Ah 
Dr Curie 
How do you do Professor 
Lovely wasn't it 
Packing 
Yes 
Wasn't it lovely 
Come in 
Dr Curie 
How do you do 
I missed you at the Graduation Exercises 
I looked all over for you 
You were there 
Yes 
Then you heard 
Yes 
My congratulation Mademoiselle 
Thank you 
You know I was 
never dreamed that I would 
I was even afraid that I might may not 
Oh I'm glad you were able to go 
Won't you sit down 
Thank you 
Yes 
I see 
Then you haven't reconsider Mademoiselle 
I'm afraid not 
Of course 
Of course 
Perhaps you might have 
You were packing 
Yes 
Oh yes naturally 
He is a doctor you know 
He is very short only you know 
but intelligent 
And my mother is quite gay 
I think you'd enjoy knowing both of them 
to spend the weekend there 
It's not far but still it's impossible 
Yes the idea's preposterous on the face of it 
The idea is not preposterous at all 
I should like to come very much 
You would 
Yes 
Thank you 
Well then 
Well then 
I hate that girl 
Eugene 
I still hate that girl 
What do you do in Poland anyway 
Spend all your time at this stupid game 
You must not mind my husband 
He never shouts at anyone unless he likes them 
That's what I thought 
He had been shouting at me all my life 
Well what are looking so gloomy about Pierre 
It's your shot 
Ah yes 
Excuse me 
I heard you're going to Poland on Tuesday 
Say Monsieur 
Excellent country Poland 
Thank you 
Of course he hasn't been there 
Well what are you waiting for 
Hit it 
Hit it 
Well I dare say it's the best thing you can do 
You can go on with your studies there 
Thank you Madame 
I'm not paying you compliments 
I'm only telling you what I see in your face 
It's all there in people's faces 
Look at my husband 
A good man and a good doctor 
Look at Pierre 
A poet but a poet with brains 
A poet in the laboratory 
It's true 
Why should I mind 
Look at Monsieur and me 
Mitchell there and young Master Mitchell 
We'll let them pass 
But then look at yours 
Fiery is it 
No 
Flame like 
That's a little nearer 
Flame like then 
Something like a flame 
You're not paying attention 
Why I tried to Father 
Then you're just plain stupid 
Oh 
Leave him alone 
No sir 
That boy has got to learn to concentrate 
Sheer luck 
I don't know how Pierre ever stumbled on to it 
Oh do be quiet Eugene 
Croquet always makes me thirsty 
Want to drink 
Thank you Father 
Yes that croquet always makes me thirsty 
Yes it stirs up the thirst in a man 
There 
I think you'll be comfortable here 
I'm sure I will 
This is Jacques' room when he was home 
Pierre's brother you know 
Oh there he is 
Where 
Oh that 
That's Pierre 
Oh no 
Really 
The other two are doctors of course 
Crazy looking group 
I think it's charming 
Well 
I hope you rest well 
Thank you 
And thank you for the lovely day 
I'd been very happy and 
You're very welcome my dear 
It is very kind of you 
It's no use Mother to talk Mdme 
Scholoscka of staying on in Paris 
I thought you've understood 
I do understand and I'm sorry 
Well good night my dear 
Good night Madame Curie 
Good night Mademoiselle 
She's a very obstinate girl Mother 
After all Poland is her home 
What's that 
Hmm stubborn 
Exactly 
That's what I mean 
Stubborn as they come 
Won't listen to reason 
Closes her mind like a clam 
Well let's go to bed 
Good night Mother 
Good night son 
Good night Father 
Good night Pierre 
She's so intelligent about other things 
Good night 
Blind as a bat 
Who 
Your son 
What is it 
What's happened 
Is anything wrong 
Dr Curie 
I find it impossible for you to leave Paris 
But what 
Please 
I must talk to you 
I found myself in a very peculiar position 
I found everything very confusing 
It's impossible to do my work 
I am helpful to you in the laboratory am I not 
Am I not 
Didn't you say that 
Yes of course 
Of course 
Well then now 
It's an excellent combination 
Sodium Chloride 
It's a stable necessary compound 
But 
I know how you feel about love about men 
I mean and I respect that feeling 
It's also my own conviction 
For the scientist there is no time for love 
A wonderful collaboration 
Don't you feel that 
I feel that 
And as for your father from what you've said 
I'm sure he would applaud such a collaboration 
He might 
What do you think I should do 
I think you are right 
I should like to stay in Paris very much 
Thank you 
We are engaged 
Engaged 
I'm sorry 
Oh Pierre 
I'm so happy 
Oh 
So very happy 
And I'm too my boy 
Very happy 
Thank you Mother 
Thank you Father 
Oh Pierre 
I am so glad 
Good night Mother 
Good night father 
Good night my boy 
Good night 
Good night 
Good night 
Quiet please 
Chaplain 
Quiet please 
Still 
How I wish you happiness Mme Curie 
Oh David 
Thank you 
You're the first one who's called me that 
Good bye Mme Curie and bon voyage 
Thank you mademoiselle 
Good bye my dear Marie 
Oh Father dear 
Good bye 
Oh congratulations lad 
Thank you 
Thank you 
Congratulations 
Thank you David 
Bye 
Bye 
Excuse me 
Now where can I put this chicken 
Mother we don't need anymore food 
We're not going at the jungle 
Good gracious what's this Pierre 
We want to read them Mother 
Well this is the last straw 
Mother we want those books 
The chicken will do you fine I assure you 
Science books on your honeymoon 
My boy good bye 
Good bye 
Ready Marie 
Here they go 
You're very lovely Marie 
Thank you Pierre 
Music is lovely isn't it 
Yes 
Thank you 
Pierre 
Yes 
Would you hate to get back 
What should I work on Pierre 
Oh yes 
Yes a number of things but 
What is it 
Why did you stop 
Oh nothing 
It's just an idea that went through my mind 
Well what was it 
The pitch blende and the plate he exposed to it 
Yes 
You know Pierre 
I can't get that out of my mind 
Really 
Why 
I don't quite understand 
Yes 
Life will die if it is inflate 
What is this energy 
Where does it come from 
I supposed I'm being very foolish 
Maybe something beyond this 
It's that kind of foolishness Marie 
Well I'm not that person I'm sure 
How do you know 
Perhaps you are 
Maybe a long and unexplored road ahead 
I wouldn't even know how to start Pierre 
I wouldn't know what to do 
Darling 
Hello Marie 
Thought I would never get away 
Just tonight when we're having guests 
I have a terrible problem 
I hope I got the things you wanted me to get 
Mother likes carrots and Father likes turnips 
And here's some flowers for the cook 
Thank you Pierre 
What's the matter Marie 
Oh Pierre 
I'm so discouraged 
Looks like this method of mine is all wrong 
I wonder if I'm trying something beyond me 
What is it exactly that's wrong 
I don't know 
My measurements 
they don't mean anything 
Maybe the electrometer is not working right 
That's what I'm afraid of 
I wish you'd examine it for me Pierre 
I'll go over it tomorrow 
Let's forget it tonight 
Let's not talk not even think the laboratory 
Promise 
I promise 
Well Pierre 
What is it 
Marie about those measurements 
Oh 
I forgot 
I'm sorry 
No more 
I'm terribly sorry 
Here they are 
Where's my coat 
Here we are 
Hello dear 
Pierre 
Mother 
I smell turnips 
We got carrots for you 
Oh how sweet of you 
Oh I brought you some of my new plum jelly 
Thank you Mother 
She made it but I brought it 
Ah thank you Father 
Let me have your things 
Your coat Father 
Yeah 
You're not treating her right Pierre 
She looks pinkish 
Oh it's silly 
Why you look lovely dear 
Just the same she's too thin 
And I say a woman without a child is a parasite 
What is being her excuse to have life 
Why would she ever born 
She's a blood sucker 
Now don't call names George 
Are you listening to me 
Of course 
A woman without a child is a blood sucker 
We didn't mean you my dear 
Oh yes 
She's just the one I did mean 
But I'm going to have a child 
When 
Soon I hope 
Oh my dear 
Marie 
Yes dear 
Look who's going to say something at last 
Are you sure the insulation is dry 
Yes Pierre 
He's getting quite chatty lately isn't he 
Don't bother them 
They're thinking of something 
I don't believe it 
Did you check the ground connection 
I don't know 
I thought you gave it to me in good order 
Pierre that could be possible couldn't it 
Yes 
Yes of course 
In that case my measurements may be correct 
Yes 
That's right 
Pierre that's it 
That must be it 
Yes that must be it 
Alright 
Alright Go ahead and check it 
Father it's just that well 
Marie has so many setbacks with her work 
That's alright 
Don't stop doing 
Please 
Go ahead 
It's alright my dear 
Thank you my boy 
Thank you 
Good bye 
Nice having dinner with you 
It happens every time 
Well 
It's alright 
Nothing wrong with it 
I was wrong 
I was sure we've found it 
Well 
I don't know 
I'm sorry 
You tested all of the elements 
you're sure of that Marie 
Yes I'm positive Pierre 
That's right 
And that's when I run into trouble 
You wouldn't mind 
Of course not 
Alright 
Here is crude pitch blende 
Those two elements give off the rays 
Correct 
I put the pitch blende in this mortar 
Has the mortar always been clean 
Always and grinded up 
I also fill a disk level full 
Just like what I've done every time 
Then I placed it in the electrometer 
And I close the case so there is no draft 
Good 
Right 
Start 
Ready 
Read 
Eight 
Eight 
Same reading as I always had 
Now here is pure uranium 
I strike it in the same amount of pitch blende 
Right 
Ready 
Read 
Two same as always 
Done nothing wrong so far 
Not that I can see 
I am going to test the thorium 
From the same amount of pitch blende 
Right 
Ready 
Read 
Two 
I don't understand 
There must be a mistake 
But individually they only total four 
I checked every elements 
There is no the result 
Every elements in existence 
Where are those four missing points 
That is what I don't understand 
I don't understand 
Of course 
Could I see it 
Yes 
Uranium oxide 75% 
Chlorium Oxide 13% Lead sulfide 3% 
Silicon dioxide 2% Calcium oxide 3% 
Barium oxide 2% Iron oxide 1% 
Pierre Yes 
All of our scientist based on that 
All of our science is based on that 
Yes Go on 
But They were wrong weren't they 
They were wrong 
Now we know that there are 78 elements 
That is right 
Pierre 
What would that mean 
It is cold in here 
Tell me what you are thinking 
I don't quite dare 
Go on and say it now matter how crazy it sounds 
What if the conception of science is wrong 
Pierre 
We have discovered a new element 
An active element 
The residue for pitch blende 
What was left over 
Where it is 
In the resin 
Close the curtains 
Ready 
Ready 
Read 
Four 
Oh Pierre 
Marie 
This new concept 
Ah my wife has named it radium 
Oh yes radium 
I should like to ask Dr Curie a question 
Yes Professor Roger 
This work 
Will it require quite a little time will it not 
Yes of course 
Under these conditions hardly seems promising 
Gentleman 
If you please 
This remark seems to me entirely irrelevant 
I might say her ah a most unusual woman 
You can't classify her with that term 
The roof leaks 
It has no floor but the wet ground 
It can't be heated 
And do you imagine that 
If you do gentlemen believe me 
We shall be very grateful to have the shade 
The place was even worse than they had expected 
There was no equipment 
Well yes they probably would 
They were that kind of people 
Then acid was poured in 
This was to dissolve out the salts 
Eventually months run into years 
was the precious illusive radium 
No separation 
No separation 
No separation 
Reduction of pitch blende nearly finish 
Only barium and radium remain 
The next separation will give radium 
November the 8th 1899 
First experiment 
No separation 
November the 10th 1899 
Second experiment 
No separation 
July the 16th 1900 
Four hundred and fifty eight experiments 
Radium still refuses to separated from barium 
We'll never find a way of separating 
Barium and radium can not be separated 
The world has done without radium up to now 
I can't give it up 
For the past three three and a half years 
And have these burns given you much pain 
I see 
Cancer 
No Pierre 
He only said the burns might develop malignantly 
Like develop into cancer 
But the very word frightens me 
You saw how it took my own mother 
We'll have to give up our experiments 
I wouldn't allow it 
I wouldn't let you take such risk 
I won't permit you 
No Marie 
Pierre please 
Listen to me please 
Very well Marie 
As I left the doctor I have been thinking 
Power enough to affect healthy tissue like mine 
Power enough to destroy tissue 
You realize what that might mean 
It could heal 
Like cancer 
You 
Yes Pierre 
It might even do that 
But Marie 
Oh Pierre 
It might prevent great sicknesses even deaths 
Pierre 
Marie's fingers healed 
Here we see the sort of things they had to do 
This is called crystallization 
When the liquid evaporates crystals are left 
Crystallizing and re crystallizing 
I think I feel like crying 
Professor Poirot 
Professor Poirot 
No No We have finished 
We have nothing to do now but wait 
I am delighted to see you 
Thank you 
The name of Curie will lead all the rest 
Why don't you introduce me Poirot 
I think I know 
Isn't it Lord Kelvin 
Here are the evaporating dishes 
Tell him Pierre 
Look here sir 
Five thousands six hundred and seventy seven 
Five thousands six hundred and seventy seven 
And thus crystallization 
What a historic moment 
Pure radium 
Mine is just as well 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Goodbye Sir 
C'mon along Poirot 
My train won't wait 
Goodnight dear 
Goodbye 
We have a coin over there 
We wrote something out for this occasion 
Good bye 
God blessed you 
Good bye 
Good bye 
What a wonderful man 
The really great men are always simple and good 
Yes 
We're both very tired 
Yes 
Shall we try to get some rest 
Very well 
Sit here a while and I cover you with this robe 
There 
Put that chair over 
I can't reach you 
Yeah 
That's better 
Let's try to doze off 
Pierre 
What time is it 
I overslept 
I must be tired 
It is five 
Must be crystallized by now 
Must be there 
Our radium must be there 
C'mon 
Do you mind 
You look first 
Only a stain 
What had happened Pierre 
Where is our radium 
What have we done 
Where is it 
What's happened 
Where is it Pierre 
I don't know 
What did we do that was wrong 
What could we have done 
We've done nothing wrong 
I can't stand it Pierre 
Where is our radium 
We worked for years and years and years 
It must be there 
It must be there 
Four long years in this shed 
Four long years 
Is that you 
Yes Father 
I think you ought to take it back 
They are the same stories 
I'll go up to her 
Then what happened Mommy 
I am sorry Irene darling 
Mother just can't tell you anymore tonight 
Oh Mommy please 
What is the matter Mommy 
But I wanted to know what happen Mommy 
If you close your eyes tight 
Daddy will tell you a story 
What's it about 
Is there a princess in it 
Yes a princess 
A beautiful princes with golden hair 
Is there a prince too 
Did they love each other 
Very much 
Alright Daddy my eyes are closed 
And they grew very tired 
they would always go on together 
She is asleep 
You know we promised David that 
But I supposed you naturally don't feel like 
Oh I remember 
The New Year's Party 
But of course you don't feel like going 
Pierre we promised 
Let's go 
I'd rather 
Might help 
Good 
Good then 
Happy New Year 
Happy New Year 
Happy New Year 
Happy New Year Marie 
Happy New Year Pierre 
I can't 
I can't accept it Pierre 
If I only knew why we fail 
At the very end why should it suddenly fail 
I don't know 
I don't know 
Pierre that stain on the saucer 
Yes 
We didn't even test it did we 
No we didn't 
Something we could see and feel 
Not as much as a pinch of salt you said 
Yes 
Pierre what if it's 
a merely a question of amount 
What if that stain 
Go on 
Pierre 
It's there 
Our radium 
It's there 
It's there 
Pierre 
Pierre 
It's there 
It's there 
It's there 
Oh Pierre 
Where are they 
Are they in Paris or go wherever they are 
I am not going to tell you where they are 
The whole world is on fire from their discovery 
The publics want to know about them 
The Nobel Prize to a woman 
Yes the public must know 
Did they give it for free 
Where are they now 
They have been interviewed so much that 
They're sick 
They've gone away on a holiday to rest 
Dr or Madame Curie at the present time 
I'm sorry 
Excuse me 
Do you think I could see Madame Curie 
I'm afraid you can't see her 
They've come here to rest 
It's their first holiday in five years 
You wouldn't want to disturb them 
Perhaps you could tell me something about her 
I can't go back without some sort of story 
Oh I certainly would 
Well 
Next week 
There 
Fair enough 
That's fine Madame 
That's wonderful 
I don't know how to thank you 
Madame 
Good bye 
Are you are you Mme Curie 
Yes 
And this is my daughter Irene 
It's a new bicycle so she has to show it off 
And now 
Mommy 
Oh yes 
My baby 
She's been a good baby 
Very good Madame 
Been very good darling 
Yes 
Wei Madame 
Did she drink her milk 
Yes 
Alright 
Wei Madame 
Well keep her out in the airy deck 
Alright 
Off you go 
Now she made a grand tour of the garden 
And now you'll excuse me 
Good bye 
Good bye 
Know what I'm doing 
Pierre 
I thought you were asleep 
No I'm walking through the new laboratory 
Don't imagine it too grand 
It might not come up to your expectations 
And I'm with you 
Yes you are with me 
Now I'm examining your work table 
I don't believe it's large enough 
How's yours 
Oh yes 
I haven't got there yet 
It will be exciting won't it 
When we walk in the first time 
Yes 
It will be wonderful to get back to work again 
We lost so much time 
Oh Pierre 
The time we spent here hasn't been lost 
We got our strength back 
Yes that's true 
We were ill both of us more than we knew 
You know when we first came here 
What do you mean 
to finish everything I wanted to finish 
It's odd how one's mind would 
Why Marie 
What a horrible thought to have 
It's just because I was so ill 
How could such a thought entered your mind 
Oh darling 
Don't take it so seriously 
It frightens me 
I'm sorry I mentioned it 
It was nothing 
It's because I was so worn out 
You know Marie how tired I was 
Pierre 
Couldn't be expected of us could it 
Oh Marie 
I've upset you 
Could it Pierre 
You were wrong Marie 
One must work just the same 
Only one more week 
Just think of it 
After all this waiting only one more week 
Pierre 
Yes dear 
Come back here 
Ha 
Come back 
What is it 
I want to tell you something 
Sit down 
Well 
What is it 
So hard 
I just can't find the words 
Pierre are you proud of me 
Marie 
Because I'm so proud of you 
I'm so proud that sometimes I think I'll burst 
You're a very great man Pierre 
Not the way the world means 
Just you 
Your kindness your gentleness and your wisdom 
I love you Pierre so deeply 
I never dreamed 
I'm so thankful Pierre 
That's what I wanted to tell you 
That's what I thought you'll always know 
Well are you truly impressed 
At 6:30 on 19th April that's today you know 
Not bad eh 
Not bad 
Good morning 
Good morning 
Good morning Father 
Good morning Good morning children 
What's the matter with this place today 
Where is your mother 
I haven't seen her for hours 
And ah 
Where's my coffee 
I'm late 
Oh 
Thank you Lucille 
Don't know where your mother has gone 
The house without a woman 
I don't understand 
Marie 
Mother's in there 
What's she doing in there 
Mother's in there 
Mother's in there 
Marie 
I wouldn't go in there Pierre if I were you 
It's supposed to be a surprise 
Oh good 
Good 
That's a very sound idea 
Yeah 
Remember I didn't tell you 
No 
Pardon me is Dr Pierre here 
That's him 
Oh 
Mme Curie would like to see you 
You like it Pierre 
It's for this evening for the ceremony 
You look very beautiful Marie 
You really like it 
I do 
Very much 
What color is that 
It's ah very deep red 
Oh nonsense 
Yes 
Yes you should 
Something something bright 
I've seen them on women 
They look nice 
Now you're making me self conscious 
Oh look at that 
Our beautiful day ruined 
Well I must be off 
I have a hundred things to do today 
I promise to go to the institute 
You mustn't be late 
You must allowed yourself time to dress 
Madame 
Madame the pins 
Oh 
Oh 
Perhaps one day I'll get a new dress suit 
Looks bad on me isn't it 
No Pierre 
You look very handsome in anything 
Thank you Marie 
Good bye 
Good bye darling 
They're always calling for us at six 
I'll be here 
Don't forget your rubbers 
No 
Or your umbrella 
Good bye 
Good bye Pierre 
Pierre 
Is there something I can show you Monsieur 
We're going to a party tonight 
Yes Monsieur 
Did you have anything special in mind 
May I ask the color of the gown monsieur 
It's dark red 
It's rather a special gown 
Not blow of course but 
What do you think of these Monsieur 
They're amethysts They're very lovely 
Oh yes aren't they 
And what are these 
Those are garnets 
Really 
They're both lovely 
I hardly know 
It would depend on the shape of the lady's face 
Is it oval or round 
I would say that her face was oval 
Yes oval 
And is she blond or 
Blond definitely 
But not too blond 
I mean she can't well just blond 
And her hair is sort of gold you know 
Gold 
Yes 
And her eyes are gray 
Very calm gray 
The coloring is very lovely 
Lovely 
You look very beautiful my dear 
Thank you 
Thank you Father 
Well you know Pierre 
I brought in some wine 
Oh that was thoughtful of you Father 
Let me 
Pierre 
He was instantly killed 
It came at such no pain 
Has she any better 
Just the same 
I can't get her to speak to me 
I'm frightened 
Is she in there 
Yes 
Forgive me if I intrude 
Please try to attend to what I say 
Try to hear my words 
Think what Pierre what he should do 
How he would want you to live now 
My friend 
I know how much the laboratory meant to Pierre 
I know how much hurt if it wasn't to be yours 
One must go on working just the same 
Ha 
I was wrong 
Marie there are more stars 
Yes she was famous now 
Mme Curie 
We have made discoveries 
Look for the clear light of truth 
Divine wonder will never fail us 
Every age has its own dream 
Leave then the dreams of yesterday 
Well 
That guy's awful slow gettin' there 
I feel sorry for him 
I got a feeling she could do better 
You're boasting What'll you have 
Whisky 
What've you got 
Whisky 
You ever see such a guy 
That's rotten ain't it 
Rotten 
Two glasses and a bottle 
Well what's on you boys' mind 
Does something' have to be on my mind 
Well there's mud in your eye 
Friendly cuss ain't he 
His girl 
If you mean Rose Mapen no 
That's a lie 
She said she'd wait 
It's a fact 
What a town 
It's my guess the married women run her out 
Oh no tar and feathers No rails 
Not that she ever did anything but 
Say what is there to do in this town anyway 
We don't 
That leaves you five choices 
Eat sleep drink play poker or fight 
Or you can shoot some pool 
I got a new table in the back room 
That's just great 
I see Risley's still around 
The sheriff 
Could be 
Gettin' to be a kind of touchy subject huh 
Afraid they'll find out it's somebody they know 
Maybe 
They lose some more this spring Some 
How many 
About 600 head 
They got any leads 
Sure 
And there hasn't been any 
Except you two 
That ain't funny 
Now who's touchy 
You're talking about my business 
Stick to my pleasures 
Listen 
Take it easy Gil 
Keep your mouth shut about Rose see 
OK Gil 
You can take a joke can't you 
Sure I can take a joke 
Some jokes 
Lost any over your way 
You haven't got any ideas have you Farnley 
Except not to have ideas 
Make that clear 
You still talkin' about rustling 
And strangers 
Looks happy don't he 
He just needed exercise 
It doesn't matter whether he wins or not 
He feels fine again afterwards 
Ain't that guy got there yet 
Holy cow 
Now I'm gonna have to start all over again 
Somebody's sure in a hurry 
Did Darby use his fist 
No a bottle 
That's all right then 
Hey lay off Farnley will ya 
Why should I 
Because you hit him pretty hard 
You made him look foolish 
Did I really get him 
I thought you busted his neck 
No foolin' 
Why that no good 
Shot right through the head I tell ya 
Where'd it happen 
You see him 
No sir but Olsen did 
When 
Any cattle missing 
Olsen send you for us 
Hey Jeff 
Rustlers 
Looks that way 
Who was it they got 
Kinkaid 
Farnley's buddy 
Yeah 
Sure I knew him 
I judge 
Wait Jeff 
There's no rush 
Even if they have got a five hour start 
It's a good 500 miles to the first border 
Besides there may be a bunch of 'em 
Better wait till we know what we're doing 
So if we go we're sure to get what we go after 
OK 
Make your posse 
Remember this ain't just rustling It's murder 
Wait a minute men 
You don't see no profit in this 
If we go you're going with us fat gut 
Brother I wouldn't miss it 
Who knows maybe this is yours 
I'll remember that and see you handle the rope 
That's right 
I say stretch 'em 
It ain't just a rustler we're after 
It's a murderer 
Count me in too 
Come on boys Get your guns 
You mustn't do this thing 
You must not 
Shut up Grandma 
Will you do me a favour Carter 
That depends 
I want you to go along and help explain 
Come on 
Let's go 
Oh wait a minute 
Do you know Mapes 
The one they call Butch 
Think I don't know my business huh 
You don't look very well Mr Davies 
Maybe you could get the flowers 
So long as he's a good dead one 
Get your hat and gun 
I'm not going Father 
I don't wish any argument 
Well 
Why is the judge at home ma'am 
Yes Can we see him 
You got business 
No we just dropped in for tea 
Very funny 
It's not regular office hours 
That the judge's better half 
His housekeeper 
His wife's dead 
Come in 
Come in 
He says come in 
All right I guess Judge 
And what can I do for you gentlemen 
We're here for Mr Davies 
Oh How is my friend Davies 
Well I trust 
Oh a matter of a private nature eh 
Yes sir 
Risley ain't here He deputised me 
Where'd the sheriff go 
Down to Kinkaid's ranch early this morning 
When will he be back 
He didn't say 
Couple of days maybe 
But anything you can tell him you can tell me 
Certainly Mapes certainly 
All right 
But if it's a sheriff's job call me see 
Naturally 
Well what can I do for you gentlemen 
You can talk to them They'll listen to you 
No No no that's not my job 
I haven't any police authority 
That's sheriff's work ain't it 
That's no posse That's a lawless lynching mob 
I'm gonna deputise them all proper 
Should we tell Davies you're coming Judge 
Yes Yes of course 
I suppose I'll have to 
Coming along Sparks 
No sir Mr Smith I don't guess so 
Oh you better come along Sparks 
You won't have to do nothin' 
All the real work's signed up 
Maybe you're right Mr Smith 
They're kidding you Sparks 
Maybe I ought to go along 
There's an old horse in my shed you can use 
Thank you sir I'll go and fetch it 
Ya haw Here comes Ma 
Come on 
We're ready to go Hiya boys Come on Jenny 
Judge Tyler 
Davies asked him to come over 
I understand how it is men 
Cut the stumping' Tyler 
All we want is your blessing 
Judge you can't impede what don't move anyway 
Now listen 
Listen men 
That right Judge 
Yes 
He's been there all morning 
Yes 
All you'll get out of it is a long hard ride 
It'll be dark before long and mighty cold 
I'll make it two 
It's not like you were giving up boys 
It's just good sense 
Farnley come back 
I'm not asking you 
I'm telling you 
Yeah and I know who's gonna take care of it 
Me 
Disbanding men 
Of what Mr Davies 
Why of of 
Yes of course 
They didn't 
They went east by Bridger's Pass 
That's through the mountains 
Over the old stage road to Pike's Hole 
But that's 8 000 feet up 
Approximately 
They'd be crazy to go that way 
How come you're so sure Tetley 
Pancho saw them He was coming back from Pike's 
Had trouble getting by them in the pass 
Sí He not see me I think 
Cattle 
Sure 
Why do you think I had to get out of his road 
Go on 
What kind of marks 
That's Kinkaid's mark 
The dirty rats 
How many were there 
Forty head 
I mean rustlers 
Three 
I knew my son would want to go along 
It's scarcely what I choose Davies 
I promise that I'll abide by the majority will 
That's where I come in 
Risley made me a deputy 
How 'bout it boys 
Suits me Butch Go ahead and pray 
Raise your right hands 
Say I do 
I do 
Tetley 
You coming 
Get my horse 
I'm going with them 
Doin' this in the middle of the night's crazy 
I thought you liked excitement 
It's just I don't like doing it in the dark 
Funnier things have happened 
Well we didn't have to come 
Look kind of funny if we hadn't wouldn't it 
Besides I like to pick my own bosses 
Whether we picked them or not we sure got 'em 
Farnley and that renegade Tetley 
He never even saw the South till after the war 
That's right 
Mind if I come in a little closer Mr Carter 
No come on 
I'm finding it kind of lonesome myself 
Powerful cold tonight ain't it 
I got a blanket if you want it 
No 
Thank you just the same Mr Carter 
Better have a couple of shots 
I never use it 
Ah it's a way of spending time 
He marks the sparrow's fall 
I seen my own brother lynched Mr Carter 
I was nothin' but a little fella 
Had he done what they picked him up for 
I don't know 
Nobody never did know for sure 
Darby sure sells rotten liquor 
Warms you up though 
Feels like fire creepin' in the short grass 
I guess I'll just let her spread a little while 
Who to 
Chuck that butt or I'll plug you 
Start something 
For every hole you make I'll make two 
Listen something's coming 
Fools Stop Stop it

Rustlin' 
Ever hear of it 
Rustlin' 
And murder 
Murder 
Oh Mr Martin what did we do 
It's all right Dad 
There's some mistake 
Remember me 
He's talkin' to ya mister 
No sabe He don't speak English 
I got a different notion 
I'll make him talk 
That'll do Farnley 
Who picked you for this job anyhow 
We got him 
You cold 
Here's a fire 
Warm yourself 
And I'll advise you to control your tongue too 
We'll get along better 
Who's boss of this outfit 
I am 
And your name 
Donald Martin Where you from 
Pike's Hole 
That's a lie 
This gentleman's from Pike's Hole 
Then mister you was robbed 
That may be 
My wife's there right now 
and my two kids 
That's really too bad just too bad 
So far the jury don't like your story 
Suit yourself son 
Have you any cattle up here with you 
Hey Mr Martin 
I'm not gonna ask you again 
Yes I have 
How many Fifty head 
Where did you get 'em 
From Mr Kinkaid 
That's just what we figured son 
I'm no rustler though 
I didn't steal 'em 
I bought 'em and paid hard cash for them 
That's a good one 
He's wants us to wait and ask Larry Kinkaid 
He's dead 
Dead 
What do you think we're up here for 
Well how should I know 
He was all right yesterday afternoon 
We're here to see it's speeded up 
Who sent you up here 
The sheriff 
That ain't true 
The sheriff didn't even know we were comin' 
Listen men 
And it'll be murder if you carry it through 
Then I guess you're the only one Arthur 
And they haven't confessed 
Shut up 
Have you a bill of sale for those cattle 
Moore 
How long you been ridin' with Kinkaid 
Six years 
No 
Can't say that I ever did 
Yep 
I can answer that 
Well 
You don't believe me 
Would you in my place 
No 
I would prefer a confession Martin 
Take 'em back to Judge like Davies wants 
Remember that 
If your stomach for justice is cooling' Carter 
I still don't like it 
Take it easy 
This ain't our picnic 
No 
Speak up man 
You're taking it like a woman 
Keep your chin up 
You can only die once son 
No 
He works for me 
I didn't do it 
I ain't even got a gun 
Then who did 
The Mexican did it 
He told me so 
Eh no 
I saw him do it 
Uh yes he did Mr Martin 
He was asleep and he didn't mean to tell me 
But I was awake and 
I heard him talkin' about it 
He invents things 
Shut up 
First he won't talk Now he talks too much 
What's his name 
Alva Hardwick 
And the other 
Juan Martinez No it ain't 
Still don't remember me eh 
I'm talkin' to you mister 
No sabe 
The devil you don't 
He was a gambler They want him for murder 
How about that 
I don't know 
Stick together nice don't they 
What do you know about the old man 
I don't know he he was in the army 
Confederate or Union 
I don't know 
He's not clear about it himself 
Maybe both at different times 
A half wit in the army 
Attention 
Oh he's forgotten 
Not that 
I'll make a deal with you Martin 
None of us killed anybody 
Then that's all I guess 
Bring 'em along 
You don't mean you're gonna do it 
Pull You got to wait I tell you 
You got to wait You got to give us some time 
We haven't done anything 
Throw the other rope up 
Remember the Mexican's mine 
My kids 
One of 'em is just a baby 
Nothing 
I've got to write a letter 
That ain't asking' much 
They're scared and trying to put it off 
They won't come in time 
I believe you're right Mr Davies 
Though I doubt if you want to be 
What time is it 
Five minutes after three 
All right 
Bring 'em back 
Sure And them time to think it over 
I can't write like this 
Very well untie them 
Thank you 
Why look 
Fresh beef 
Oh Ma Fix up a spread for everybody 
What are you thinkin' about 
Suppose he don't get here at all 
That's what I'm thinking 
And if it isn't I don't want to 
Yes 
What right have you got to show my letter 
Don't raise your voice rustler 
He's right Smith 
I told him I'd keep it for him 
I asked you to make sure that it was delivered 
I was just trying to prove that you were 
I said I'm sorry 
I was merely trying 
I don't care what you were doing 
I didn't write that letter to be passed around 
It's none of these murderers' business 
I made no promise son 
Give me my letter 
I'll see that she gets it 
Oh I wouldn't have her touch it now 
In that case give him back the letter 
Your wife ought to hear from you son 
She'll want to keep it 
for your children 
I'm sorry 
Hey the Mex 
Spread out 
He might have a gun 
Mapes 
Winder 
Where's he hit 
In the leg 
Here's his gun 
Well I guess we know now don't we 
Look 
Say that's Larry Kinkaid's gun 
Where did you get this 
Ha 
So he speaks American 
And ten other languages my dear 
My leg please 
Don't give him no knife 
Better than any of you no doubt 
I'll do it 
That was very fine shooting my friend 
You should try again with that one 
Now where'd you get that gun 
Found it 
Where Lying in the road 
You're a liar 
You're a liar 
And you're a blind fool 
I asked you where you got it 
No sabe Well that's the truth He did find it 
Undoubtedly 
Won't you even read it 
Is it because you've made up your minds 
It's a beautiful letter 
Maybe 
Mr Davies 
Are you willing to abide by majority decision 
How about the rest of you 
Sure 
Majority rules with me 
Excuse me 
Seven 
Not a majority I believe Mr Davies 
Any other message you'd like to leave Martin 
I don't wanna die 
I'd like to make a confession 
I didn't do it And about time 
To a priest 
There's no priest here 
This man can hear me and take it to a priest 
All right 
Get along with it 
I don't want to die 
I don't want to die 
Bring him along 
I didn't do anything I didn't

I won't do it You'll do it 
I 
I can't 
We'll see to it that you can 
This is not your affair Carter 
I'll have no female boys bearing' my name 
You'll do your part 
and say nothing more 
What did he say 
I ain't no priest 
Well I ain't no priest I don't know

It's not for myself I'm asking 
It's too bad but it's justice

You don't care if you've got the right men 
All you know is somebody's got to be punished 
This is a fine company for a man to die with 
Shut up You shut up

Tear 'em loose 
Don't let 'em do that 
Stop it

Why should I when you lied to me 
I hadn't counted on your family Find a man 
What man 
This man we want may be your uncle 
We're after one man Your uncle may be that man 
He knows it would kill my mother if he did 
Why don't they arrest that man in the East 
Why don't you go away and leave us alone 
We'd been brought up about the same 
What do you mean It doesn't matter 
It's the only thing that does 
And you're going to keep your mouth shut

Maybe I'd better not take any 
Oh imported

Travel or current events 
Oh not current events We get current events 
Who'll my audience be 
Women keep busy in towns like this 
In the cities it's different 
And what do the wives do these useless women 
Proud of their jewellery but of nothing else 
Horrible faded fat greedy women 
But they're alive They're human beings 
Are they Are they Charlie 
Well I seem to be making my speech right here 
Joe it's Herbert 
He always comes when we're eating 
Good evening Mrs Newton 
Good evening Mr Oakley Good evening 
Well Herb how's your mother

You folks are getting pretty stylish 
Mushrooms mean anything to you Joe 
Suppose I would Why 
Oh what's the matter with you two 
Do you always have to talk about killing people 
We're not talking about killing people 
It's your father's way of relaxing 
Can't he find some other way to relax

More than that We're like twins

How could you do such things 
You're my uncle my mother's brother

There's so much you don't know So much 
What do you know really

Give it to me 
Graham and the other fellow they don't know 
Charlie give me this last chance 
Take your chance Go

You seem pretty sure he's the man we want Why 
I won't do anything to help him I promise 
But you can't ask me to spy on him 
I'll let you know when he leaves 
Ann I broke my mother's back three times 
They're all true 
Goodbye Goodbye Mr Graham Mr Saunders

Sure does Never cared much for that case

There's nothing to pretend about 
There's mother's gloves 
Mothers don't lose daughters they gain sons 
Who'd want a detective for a son in law

I'm glad you were able to come Jack 
He thought the world was a horrible place 
He couldn't have been very happy ever No 
He didn't trust people He seemed to hate them 
He hated the whole world 
It seems to go crazy every now and then 
Like your Uncle Charlie 
My name is Jane Eyre 
Money and position seemed all that mattered 
Charity was a cold and disagreeable word 
I had no father or mother brother or sister 
Careful Bessie 
Come on out Jane Eyre 
Mrs Reed wants to see you in the drawing room 
Go on knock Knock 
Don't bully the child 
Come in 
She's the daughter of my late husband's sister 
For some years she's lived in this house 
Come here little girl 
What is your name 
Jane Eyre sir 
Well Jane Eyre and are you a good child 
The less said on that subject the better 
Indeed 
That isn't true 
He hit me first 
Jane Silence 
John dear did you strike her first 
No indeed Mama You did 
I did not You did 
Silence 
I won't listen to your odious lies 
No sight so sad as that of a wicked child 
Do you know where the wicked go after death 
They go to hell 
And what is hell 
A pit full of fire 
No sir 
Then what must you do to avoid it 
I must keep in good health and not die 
But children younger than you die daily 
Only last week we buried a little child of 5 
A good little child whose soul is now in heaven 
But what of your soul 
I don't see why it shouldn't go to heaven too 
You don't see 
But others see clearly enough do they not 
You have heard the name of Lowood 
No sir 
It is a school for unfortunate orphans 
Would you like to go there little girl 
You mean not live here anymore 
I don't know what Aunt Reed would say 
Do you wish to go 
Yes sir 
You've made a wise choice Wiser than you know 
Bessie 
Yes Jane 
What does Bessie care for me 
She's always scolding and punishing 
Rather sorry Is that all 
I'll kiss you and welcome Bessie 
You're such a strange solitary little thing 
Here's a keepsake Jane 
It'll help you remember me 
Come on hurry up 
Be a good girl And I hope you'll be happy 
Thank you Bessie 
Goodbye Jane 
I'll never come and see you again 
I'll never call you aunt as long as I live 
And if anyone asks me how you treated me 
I'll say you are bad and hardhearted and mean 
And the very sight of you makes me sick 
It's called Lowood 
Here you are She's been asleep for hours 
Right away Bill 
Pupils Observe this child 
She is yet young 
She possesses the ordinary form of girlhood 
Yet such I grieve to tell you is the case 
Teachers You must watch her 
Weigh well her words and scrutinize her actions 
Punish her body to save her soul 
This girl is a liar 
I brought you this from supper 
Didn't you hear what he said 
He said you mustn't have anything to do with me 
Go on take it 
I'm not bad 
I promise I'm not But I hate him I hate him 
It's wrong to hate people 
I can't help it 
Or let a horse kick me Or be tossed by a bull 
Don't say such things 
But I would 
Eat your bread Jane 
Amen 
Helen where does that road go 
I told you before To Bradford 
But after Bradford 
Madrid isn't in Italy Jane 
That road goes there all the same 
Dreaming again Jane 
Oh Dr Rivers 
I'll beat you there 
Aah 
Aah 
Aah 
Aah 
Aah 
That cough doesn't seem any better Helen 
We'll have to take care of it 
Aah 
Aah 
Aah 
Thank you 
A matter of principle Dr Rivers 
Then I'm not a theologian 
Good day sir 
If I may venture an opinion 
Johnson you poke your chin most unpleasantly 
Edwards I insist on your holding your head up 
What may I ask is the meaning of this 
Her hair curls naturally 
I want these girls to be children of grace 
Please please sir don't do that 
So this is the spirit that prevails at Lowood 
First vanity and now insurrection 
It shall be rooted out 
Dr Rivers 
I brought this oil for Helen 
I want her chest rubbed with it Helen doctor 
Yes I'm concerned about her lungs 
I've spoken to Mr Bro 
What are they doing out in the rain 
It was Mr Brocklehurst's order 
Bring them in 
What shall I say to Mr Brocklehurst 
You will refer Mr Brocklehurst to me 
Amen 
Was it Providence that ordered her to her death 
Yes to her death Mr Brocklehurst 
Helen Helen 
I'm not afraid Jane 
Helen Helen You must be cold 
Lie down and cover yourself up 
Don't cry Jane I don't want you to cry 
Are you warm now 
Yes 
Good night Jane 
Good night Helen 
I do wish they hadn't cut your hair 
Helen 
Are you awake 
It's morning 
Helen 
Come Jane No I want to stay here 
I want to be with Helen 
Helen isn't here Helen's with God 
Thy will be done 
God wants children to be brave and strong 
Won't you do what God wants 
I'll try 
That's right 
Now let me take you back No I can't go back 
I'll never go back I'll run away 
Jane you know what duty is don't you 
Now what is your duty Jane I don't know 
Yes you do Jane 
In your heart you know perfectly well 
Isn't that true 
And who can do God's work 
An ignorant woman or an educated one 
Yes you know the answer to that 
And where can you get an education Jane 
Where 
Isn't that true 
I suppose it is true 
Good Jane 
Very good 
A very stiff necked and evil child 
But Eyre has been with us 10 years 
I suppose we ought to see her 
I intended that you should 
Let Eyre be brought in 
An outsider will have to be paid twice as much 
Eyre this is a solemn moment 
Yes a teacher 
I need detain you no longer gentlemen 
Good day gentlemen good day 
That is all Eyre 
I cannot accept your offer sir 
And why not pray 
I do not wish to stay at Lowood 
But this is unheard of 
The ingratitude 
What have I to be grateful for 
Ten years of harshness and 
Silence 
Stiff necked as ever 
I see that I've been sadly deceived in you 
And where may I ask do you intend to go 
Out into the world sir 
Out into the world 
I intend to find a position as a governess 
How may I ask 
I've advertised in a newspaper 
No sir And you never will be 
It's folly to dream of such a position 
Eyre you heard me 
I am leaving Lowood sir 
Here you are miss 
Twenty pounds is my limit 
Excuse me 
Not that I've heard ma'am 
Take seat in coffee room and I'll inquire 
Who's the young lady 
Couldn't say Just come in by coach 
Yes sir 
Oh no thank you 
Is your name Eyre 
Yes I'm Miss Eyre Are you from Thornfield 
You're not the new governess 
Yes I am 
Heh is this all your luggage 
I'll tell Mrs Fairfax you're here 
How do you do my dear 
I'm afraid you've had a tedious journey 
I'm Mrs Fairfax 
Why your hand is like ice 
Come I'll take you straight to your room 
You know dear I'm so glad you've come 
Miss Fairfax 
Oh you mean Miss Adele 
Isn't she your daughter 
Oh gracious no Adele is French 
I have no family No family at all 
That's Mr Edward's room 
His visits are always so unexpected and sudden 
Mr Edward 
Who is Mr Edward 
Why the owner of Thornfield of course 
Oh I thought this was your house 
Mine Bless your soul child 
I'm only the housekeeper 
And here is your room my dear 
Oh it's very beautiful 
Good night my dear 
Bonjour mademoiselle 
Mama had a dress like that mademoiselle 
Only she could dance much more beautifully 
I can dance too 
Do you wish to see 
Now At this very moment 
Now you speak like Monsieur Rochester 
For him it is never the right moment 
Your name's Adele isn't it 
Do you know what I was thinking Adele 
You like that mademoiselle 
Very much Adele 
I liked it 
And where was that 
In Paris We live always in Paris 
Five six and three 
Do you like Monsieur Rochester 
I've not met him yet 
This is his chair 
Is he as bad as that 
Twice as bad I cannot make how bad he is 
But I'm sure he's very kind to you 
Oh sometimes he brings me beautiful presents 
But when he's angry that's terrible 
And may the Holy Virgin give me grace 
Can I do anything 
You can stand out of the way 
I'm sorry I frightened your horse 
Apologies won't mend my ankle Down Pilot 
Well what are you waiting for 
I can't leave until I see you're fit to ride 
From Mr Rochester's house just below 
Do you know Mr Rochester 
No I've never seen him 
You're not a servant at the hall 
I'm the new governess 
Oh 
You're the new governess 
Now just hand me my whip 
Thank you Now kindly get out of the way 
Quick dear Off with your things 
He's been asking to see the governess Who 
Why Mr Rochester of course 
He won't let me send for the doctor 
Oh my goodness your bonnet 
Here is Miss Eyre sir 
Well Miss Eyre have you no tongue 
I was waiting until I was spoken to 
Very proper 
It was not deliberate 
Sit down Miss Eyre 
Where do you come from 
What's that 
It's a charity school 
I was there 10 years 
Ten years You must be tenacious of life 
I marveled where you got that sort of face 
Indeed I'm not sure yet 
Who are your parents 
I have none sir 
And your home 
I have no home sir 
Who recommended you here 
What did you learn at Lowood 
Do you play the piano 
A little 
Of course it is the established answer 
Go into the drawing room I mean if you please 
Excuse my tone of command 
I'm used to saying Do this and it is done 
Take a candle with you leave the door open 
Sit down at the piano and play a tune 
Enough 
Perhaps rather better than some But not well 
Good night Miss Eyre 
Good night 
She's a person we have to do the sewing 
How did you get on with Mr Rochester my dear 
Is he always so changeful and abrupt 
Why for him more than for anyone else 
Partly because that's his nature 
What about 
Family troubles 
It has unpleasant associations for him 
Good night my dear 
Good night Mrs Fairfax 
Look mademoiselle Mademoiselle 
You see they suit me perfectly 
A ballet dress just like Mama used to wear 
Isn't it beautiful mademoiselle 
Beautiful Adele 
I shall wear it when I dance 
I'm not fond of the prattle of children 
Sit down Miss Eyre 
Uh forward a little 
Still too far back 
You examine me Miss Eyre 
Do you find me handsome 
No sir Indeed 
I beg your pardon I was too plain 
My answer was a mistake 
Just so and you shall be answerable for it 
Now then explain 
Does my forehead not please you 
What do you tell from my head Am I a fool 
No sir far from it 
Very well madam 
No sir 
Does that leave hope for me 
Hope of what sir 
You are silent Miss Eyre 
Stubborn 
No annoyed and quite rightly so 
I put my request in an absurd way 
Do as you please sir 
Thirty pounds 
I'd quite forgotten that heh 
One I rather like 
Humbug 
Where are you going 
It's time for Adele's lesson 
Heh no young lady 
You wish to escape me 
Admit that you're afraid 
Don't I look beautiful monsieur 
This is how Mama used to do it is it not 
Precisely 
And I shall dance for you 
But monsieur 
Why are you looking at me like that 
You're quite right of course 
One of the better kind 
But circumstance decreed otherwise heh 
I was as green as you once 
Uh grass green 
Now my spring is gone leaving me what 
This little artificial French flower 
You may go Miss Eyre 
Miss Eyre 
Hope you'll be happy here at Thornfield 
I hope so sir I think so 
I'm glad 
Who's there 
Mr Rochester 
That's done it 
I think someone must've tried to kill you 
I heard footsteps along the gallery 
Shall I call Mrs Fairfax 
What the deuce do you want to call her for 
Let her sleep Come and sit down 
I'm going to leave you here 
Be still as a mouse 
Anything else 
Yes Kind of a laugh 
A kind of a laugh 
Have you heard it before 
Aah just so 
Grace Poole 
You've guessed it 
Well I see what's to be done 
Meanwhile say nothing about this to anyone 
Adele 
I had an awful fear 
You see what she has 
Poor little Adele 
Love's a strange thing Miss Eyre 
And the little doll in the dancing skirt 
Let me light you to your room 
When it's deserved 
Would you say that my life deserved saving 
I should be distressed if harm came to you sir 
At least shake hands 
I knew you'd do me good in some way sometime 
Good night Jane 
Good night sir 
Oh Miss Eyre isn't it terrible 
We might all have been burnt in our beds 
Where did Mr Rochester go 
Goodness knows how long he'll be away 
One can never tell with Mr Rochester 
It may be a day or a year or a month 
Mrs Fairfax Yes my dear 
Did Mr Rochester tell you how the fire started 
Why of course 
And the curtains took fire 
Why do you ask 
What possible connection could there be 
He said this morning that he was restless 
What art thou doing here 
No one is allowed up here 
Understand No one Get thee down 
Look mademoiselle 
Yes madam 
Yes madam 
They're coming ma'am 
One two three 
Who's that riding with Mr Rochester 
Why that's Blanche Ingram my dear 
She's quite an old flame of his 
Such a beautiful girl isn't she 
Where's Miss Ingram's bath 
Coming as quickly as we can 
Adele why aren't you in the nursery 
Mademoiselle let me look 
No dear you're in the way 
Well he is very romantic and enormously rich 
Oh please send Adele by herself 
He only asked me out of politeness 
I think the black 
They're coming mademoiselle 
What's your name 
Adele 
Now Blanche stop teasing Mr Rochester 
Six or 7000 a year at least 
What a striking couple 
Very fortunate isn't it 
I think we've had enough music 
I thought you weren't fond of children 
Nor am I Run along 
What induced you to take charge of a poppet 
Where'd you pick her up 
I did not pick her up She was left on my hands 
Well I suppose you have a governess for her 
I saw a person with her just now 
Governesses 
Don't speak to me of governesses heh 
The martyrdom I've endured with those creatures 
How do you do 
Very well sir 
What have you been doing 
Teaching Adele as usual 
What's the matter 
Nothing 
Take cold the night of the fire 
No sir 
Go back to the drawing room 
You're leaving too early 
I'm a little tired sir 
Yes and a little depressed 
I'm not depressed sir 
But I tell you you are 
Indeed they're there now shining and swimming 
What devil's that 
I wish to see Mr Rochester 
What name shall I say sir 
Very good sir 
Mason of Spanish Town 
I wish I were on a quiet island with only you 
Can I help you sir 
If help is needed I'll seek it at your hands 
I'd turn them out of the room if I could 
Would you go with them 
I would stay with you sir 
To comfort me 
Yes sir To comfort you as well as I could 
Edward 
Follow me Mason 
What is it 
What's happened 
The noise came from down there 
Where the devil's Edward 
Here he is 
Edward 
Edward you haven't been hurt have you 
Nightmares 
Now ladies you all go to your rooms 
Lady Ingram you set the good example 
I declare I'm quite disappointed 
Now Blanche less of your levity 
Good night Edward 
Sweet dreams my courageous Blanche 
Jane are you awake 
Yes sir 
Come out then quietly 
Come this way and make no noise 
I've never been tried 
Give me your hand 
It won't do to risk a fainting fit 
I beg you not to seek an explanation 
Don't try to understand 
Whatever the appearance you must trust me 
You will sponge the blood as I do now 
Do you understand me 
Whatever happens do not move from here 
Whatever happens do not open a door 
Doctor be on the alert 
Huh I'm done for I fear Nonsense 
You've lost a little blood that's all 
She sank her teeth into me like a tigress 
She said she'd drain my heart's 
Be silent Mason Forget it 
Jane 
Yes sir 
Go and get some things on 
You'll find a carriage waiting 
See that the driver's ready 
I shall be down in a moment 
Mason I told you not to come up here 
I thought I could've done some good 
You thought you thought 
Come doctor hurry We must have him off 
I've tried so long to avoid exposure 
I shall make very certain it doesn't come now 
Take care of him doctor 
Edward 
Well what is it 
Let her be taken care of 
Let her be treated as tenderly as may be 
I do my best and have done it and will do it 
That house is a dungeon a sepulcher 
Here everything is fresh real and pure 
Mr Rochester will Grace Poole live here still 
Yes Grace Poole will stay 
After last night 
Don't ask for explanations 
You're my little friend Jane aren't you 
Oh no sir that's impossible 
Am I right 
Jane I want you to use your fancy 
Imagine yourself in some remote foreign land 
Conceive that you there commit a capital error 
Tell me Jane are you justified 
How can I answer sir 
Every conscience must come to its own decision 
But it can't come to a decision 
No sir 
Give me your assurance on that 
Cold fingers 
They were warmer last night 
Jane will you watch with me again 
Whenever I can be useful 
What makes you think he's in the stable 
You think no one will have me You're wrong 
You don't know these young ladies of fashion 
Good morning Edward 
A correct host entertains his guests 
My dear Blanche when will you learn 
I never was correct nor ever shall be 
Very pretty partner Splendid Thank you 
I didn't know 
Of course how very appropriate 
What now Edward 
Put the red ball in the top pocket 
Edward does that person want you 
Very good Miss Eyre 
I'm sure the ladies will excuse me 
Governesses Mama 
What the deuce do you want a reference for 
To get a new place sir Hmm 
Yes what then 
In which case Adele ought to go to school 
Some sense in your suggestion Jane 
Adele as you say must go to school 
You mean you've been advertising 
Do you hear 
Very well sir Goodbye Mr Rochester 
Goodbye Miss Eyre 
Jane Is that all 
Seems stingy to my notion 
Dry and unfriendly 
Won't you do more than just say goodbye 
Well I'll I'll shake hands sir 
Oh you'll shake hands 
Goodbye Jane 
Why it's a paradise 
Huh 
How delightful that would be 
A green haven of peace and love Love 
Who's talking of love 
All a fellow needs is a bit of distraction 
Hmm 
Are you never serious 
You can be revoltingly coarse at times 
Can I ever be anything else 
Can you 
Would you or would you not 
Allow me my dear 
I repeat as ugly as sin 
This is the third point 
No horseplay 
I've never been so insulted in my life 
Insulted 
Mr Rochester you are a boor and a cur 
I thought you'd gone 
Why are you crying 
I was thinking about having to leave Thornfield 
To that simple old Fairfax 
Yes 
You'd be sorry to part with them 
Yes sir 
It's always the way in this life 
It's come now 
Then it's settled 
All settled Even about your future situation 
You've found a place for me 
Yes Jane I have In the west of Ireland 
It's a long way off sir 
From what Jane 
From England and from Thornfield 
Well 
And from you sir 
Yes Jane it's a long way 
We've been good friends Jane haven't we 
Yes sir 
Even good friends may be forced to part 
Let's make the most of what time has left us 
Let us sit here in peace 
Especially when you are near me as now 
As for you you'd forget me 
That I never will sir 
Where do you see that necessity 
In your bride 
What bride 
But you will have 
Yes I will I will 
As it is now for me to leave you 
There I've spoken my heart now let me go 
Jane 
Jane you strange almost unearthly thing 
You that I love as my own flesh 
Don't mock me 
I have no love for Blanche It's you I want 
Answer me Jane quickly 
I want to read your face 
Read quickly Say Edward I'll marry you 
Edward I'll marry you 
God pardon me 
I loved and I was loved 
Jane what do you think you're doing 
Teaching Adele as usual 
What is wrong with that 
You approve 
And some of that And a length of the scarlet 
Here you are milady half a guinea each way 
That's 55 and a tenner 
Tell your fortune milord Go away 
Let me read the pretty lady's future 
One moment please 
I declare the existence of an impediment 
Proceed with the ceremony 
Mr Rochester has a wife now living 
Who are you 
My name's Briggs I'm an attorney 
Mr Mason on the 20th of October 1824 
It's true it's true I swear it 
I'm her brother 
To the right about every one of you 
Away with your congratulations 
They are 15 years too late 
That gentlemen is my wife 
And this is what I wish to have 
Look at the difference and then judge me 
Jane 
Jane I did not even know her 
Jane hear me 
Then I fled from this place 
A contrast to the Fury I left here 
And what did I find 
Someone was walking there in the moonlight 
A strange little elfin like creature 
I was to be aided and by that hand 
And then later that evening 
Do you remember Jane 
Say you remember 
I remember 
you came into that room 
And then you smiled at me 
That moment I knew I'd found you 
Jane can you not forgive me 
I do forgive you 
And you still love me 
I do love you with all my heart 
I can say it now since it's for the last time 
Stay with me Jane 
We'd be hurting nobody 
We should be hurting ourselves 
Would it be so wicked to love me Would it 
Jane you are going 
I am going sir 
You will not be my comforter 
My rescuer My deep love 
My frantic prayer Are they nothing to you 
God bless you my dear master 
God keep you from harm and wrong 
Jane Jane Jane 
Going nowhere I had nowhere to go 
Without references I could not find employment 
I knew hunger and unsheltered nights 
Bessie 
Yes I'm Bessie 
You look poorly lass 
Sit down lass 
Uh where'd you get that brooch 
You gave it to me Bessie Jane 
Jane Eyre 
Oh Miss Jane 
That's your poor aunt 
Master John isn't here anymore 
As soon as he was of age he was off to London 
Gambling that's what it was 
But still he kept plaguing her for money 
Then last summer he killed himself Miss Jane 
Wandering like in her mind 
Is that you Bessie 
Yes ma'am 
Who are you 
Go away 
I'm Jane Aunt Reed 
Jane Eyre 
Jane Eyre 
Jane 
Jane Eyre 
Oh 
Oh don't leave me Jane 
Please don't leave me 
I won't leave you 
No sir missus can't see nobody 
She's been ill for months Oh I'm sorry 
Thank you 
You can't live alone like the man in the moon 
How did you know I was here 
I didn't 
I was trying to find you 
I received an inquiry about you the other day 
Didn't you like it 
What happened 
I had to leave Forgive me 
It's no business of mine 
That's near Millcote isn't it 
A client of his wants to know your whereabouts 
You know who's inquiring for you 
Thank you Dr Rivers It's for you to say 
Or would you rather I didn't answer it at all 
That's much better 
Thank you very much sir 
Going at £2 
Going going Take it away Bill 
Jane 
Jane 
Jane 
It was she who did it Miss Eyre 
She struck down Grace Poole as she slept 
And then she set fire to Thornfield 
It was her laugh in the gallery that woke me 
Mr Edward saw her as he came out 
All this side of the house was blazing 
There was smoke everywhere 
Then it cleared 
She saw him too 
He came towards her to help her down 
She stood very still for a moment 
She was dead Miss Eyre 
Mr Edward 
Mrs Fairfax 
Yes sir 
Adele is waiting for her supper 
Yes sir 
Here Pilot 
Who's there 
Who are you 
I've come back sir 
Edward Edward 
Her very fingers huh 
Her small soft fingers 
Her hair 
Her little flower soft face 
And her heart too Edward 
Jane 
All you can feel now is mere pity 
I don't want your pity 
Edward 
Don't send me away 
Please don't send me away 
You think I want to let you go

THE CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US 
Directed by VITTORIO DE SICA 
How many times have I told you: 
Don't leave your bike in the courityard 
You just don't listen 
Good morning Mrs Resta 
Have I made myself clear 
Mrs Nina 
Mommy doesn't want to go to the movies 
I'm sorry I didn't let you know 
I want to take Pricò out for some fresh air 
Very well Have a nice day 
Gabriella is in love with me 
She's in love with me 
With both of us then 
Well we can't both marry her 
There's no room for three here 
No one of us is headed for the other world 
Bon voyage 
That remains to be seen 
Take one 
Darn you 
Look there 
Finally you're dead 
I'm going to call on my beloved 
The money 
Maria 
Quick silly girl 
My love you're my hero 
My little puppet 
Shall we dance a tarantella 
Yes let's 
Mommy 
Is that a bicycle bell 
Yes 
Okay go and have fun 
Just be careful okay 
Can I ride it 
No 
Can I put my foot on it 
Okay just your foot 
That's enough 
How could I bear to see you with him 
But I can't live like this either 
What about me 
How can I bear it Roberito 
Nina can you live without me 
I can't live without you either 
What are we waiting for 
We don't have to decide today 
Today Nina 
Today 
I got a job in Genoa 
I'm leaving tonight 
I already bought tickets 
I got one for you too 
Will you be here tomorrow 
No I'm going to the movies 
A little courage 
That's all it takes 
Good morning Pricò 
Well thank you 
Thank you very much Mr Roberito 
I'm sorry It's late 
We have to go home 
It was such a pleasure running into you 
Mommy are you crying 
No why would I be 
I can't miss it 
He makes a mess and I have to clean it up 
What are they waiting for 
Are you coming or not 
His hands were dirity 
You know they won't starit without me 
You're right I'm sorry 
No need to apologize 
They'll just have to wait 
Did you have fun at the movies 
I took him to the park 
Weren't you going with Mrs Resta 
It was such a lovely day 
I saw the puppet show 
Did you enjoy it 
Yes 
Don't you like it 
I'm not hungry 
Agnese 
What else is on the agenda 
The elevator 
I curse the day I bought a condominium unit 
Goodness 
Go and live in a tenement then 
Silence please 
Let's vote on it 
One floor at a time 
A majority carries it First floor 
I say it should go both up and down 
Good evening sir 
I see we're discussing the elevator 
Sorry I'm late 
It's nothing 
For 25 lire a month you're all such misers 
Who are you calling a miser 
Misers 
Angel of God my guardian watch over me 
You who were sent to me 
And pink 
Aren't you going to give me a kiss 
Can we go see the puppet show again tomorrow 
Yes darling Tomorrow 
Put the cloth back on 
He'll drive us all crazy 
I'll put my tie on and go 
Is it Sunday Daddy 
Why 
You're not going to the office 
No it's not Sunday 
I'm going to the office 
It's already 9:30 
I'll make up some excuse for my boss 
Was Mommy here with you last night 
Yes Daddy 
Did she tuck you in 
Yes 
How could she have 
Excuse me sir 
I wanted to ask Mrs Nina for some matches 
Here you go 
Isn't she home 
Think nothing of it ma'am 
It's no bother 
Thank you 
Who was it 
Mrs Resta 
Mommy isn't here 
She's gone 
When 
She's gone 
Perhaps she's visiting relatives 
She ran off 
No need for speculation 
She ran off 
In a few hours I'll know where she's gone 
You know something then 
Everything 
You can't keep anything from me 
What about him 
Who 
The husband 
Who 
He's really a nice boy 
It doesn't go down sir 
You voted for it 
We were talking about your son 
Of course 
He's such a dear boy 
Agnese 
The boy can't stay here 
Take him to his aunt's 
This style has no ribs 
Really 
It allows total freedom of movement 
Try it Mrs Mancini 
I'm on my way 
Make sure they pay you 
What if they don't 
How much is it 
For you 480 
Then don't give them the corset 
That's really excessive 
It's a special price for you 
This is a new line 
And it's so flattering on you 
You'll look so slim 
I'm going I'm going 
What a pain 
Is Mrs Berelli in 
In the other room 
Excuse me ma'am 
The master sent me because 
What's happened 
He'd like you to keep the child 
He'll pick him up tonight 
What about my sister 
Mommy's gone 
Ma'am how much is it in satin 
630 
Highway robbery 
When did she leave 
Last night 
Then she must have planned 
I never would have thought 
So it's really 
Ma'am I'll keep my own after all 
It's more flattering 
As you wish ma'am 
Good day 
Didn't she leave a note or anything 
Actually I think 
Couldn't that blessed woman have 
Girls keep him enteritained 
Come with me 
You'll have fun with us 
Sit down 
And that poor man at home 
Couldn't she leave him a note 
Nothing 
That foolish girl 
Did she have to leave 
What about him 
What time is it 
4:00 
I'm so sleepy 
Why are you so sluggish today 
I saw Gino last night 
You wish you had a guy like him 
What did you do 
You know he has 
He used the usual lines 
It's just for half an hour 
No one will see you 
I don't like him 
Shut up 
Did you go with him 
Of course 
What time did you get home 
This morning 
I can't help it 
I just don't like him 
You don't like anyone 
Well I don't like him 
Good night 
I'm sorry but this is a rush job 
Please sit down 
It's unbelievable 
Unbelievable 
Who would ever have thought 
You never expect something like this to happen 
She didn't come here 
No I told you on the phone 
But did you know anything 
Me 
How could I have known 
And what about you 
You trying to say it's my fault 
Are you ready dear 
Excuse me 
Come in 
I'm running a little late 
Family business 
I'll be done in a minute 
Would you wait in here a moment 
Of course 
All right I understand 
I get it 
Come on 
We're going to Grandma's 
I know how you feel poor man 
What's going on 
Nina ran off with Roberito 
That's all 
Scoundrels 
Where's the child 
I thought he'd be here by now 
And where have you been 
At the drugstore 
The drugstore 
What for 
Your medicine 
You got it for me yesterday 
I just thought 
Go find him 
What a nuisance 
Sixteen lire 
What a nuisance this boy is 
Naughty boy you ran off 
You're the one who ran off 
You'll hear from your grandmother now 
Don't turn around in the street 
Then why did you 
That's just dandy 
Look at the state you're in 
It's unbelievable the way you've been raised 
I don't have a maid even in my condition 
Well enough said 
Your father brought you to me 
Things will be different here 
I want to live in peace 
You understand 
I want to live in peace 
Can I play in the haystack again tomorrow 
Aren't you gonna give me a kiss 
If you promise to go to sleep 
Paolina 
He could have killed her 
How do you feel 
It hurits 
Come now don't exaggerate 
It's nothing Andrea 
A little scrape 
You were right to punish him 
You should have stayed in bed 
But I'm sure 
No he's a strange little boy 
At your age you weren't like him believe me 
Mother dear even if it was a mistake 
I married her 
Are you defending her 
Enough 
Would you prefer cheese or ham 
Neither Daddy I want water 
More water 
You didn't eat any breakfast either 
I'm not hungry Daddy 
You're feverish 
Do you feel sick son 
Are you cold 
I didn't mean to hurit Paolina 
How do you feel Pricò 
Water Daddy 
I'll give you some water 
I want to live in peace 
How do you feel darling 
Why are you wearing your hat 
Why don't you take off your hat 
Mommy can't stay with us 
Daddy doesn't want me to 
What if I say I want you to 
Who do you think you are 
The master of the house 
If Mommy leaves I'm going with her 
Mommy's going to the store now 
She'll get you some wonderful toy soldiers 
Don't leave 
Take your hat off 
to the movies 
Yes dear 
What are you doing here 
Do you mean to drive me from my own house 
Is that what you want 
Out with it 
Let me come home 
I thought you might come back 
Not for my sake of course 
Like my trumpet 
When can we leave 
Very good 
I don't want to play blacksmith with you 
Everything's fine 
I'm so relieved 
But what's wrong with you ma'am 
Why I'm fine 
You seem changed 
Is something the matter 
What a fatty 
Fority two pounds 
Forty four pounds 
Thank heavens 
You had me frightened 
Ten days ago he weighed just 42 
Perhaps it's better this way 
Yes dear go see the horses 
He still hasn't spoken a word to me 
What about you and your business 
Once summer begins just look how they dress 
Roberito arrived yesterday 
He came to see me of course 
He asked me to have you over 
He absolutely must see you 
He keeps saying 
I just have to see her for five minutes 
We've broken up so many times 
I finally found the strength to stop seeing him 
He should find that strength too 
The poor boy 
He's already up to 46 
See I was right 
Back to normal weight in one month 
What does he weigh 
Fority six 
Thank goodness 
We can be thankful 
We can consider ourselves lucky 
Agnese get me the old wire cutters 
I want to help you 
All right but don't touch anything 
I must talk to you about something 
We have to give the boy 25 lire 
Make it 30 
Tomorrow's the 10th 
He should buy flowers for Mother's Day 
We've done it every year 
He should buy her flowers this year too 
Thank goodness 
No bread 
Happy Mother's Day 
Happy Mother's Day 
Thank you 
You remembered 
Sit down 
Andrea 
I bought it 
Yes Pricò insisted 
Thank you but it's too nice 
190 480 
125 600 
412 
Andrea 
Brown would just kill the blue 
Pearl gray or 
Either pearl gray or a very light blue 
Those are your only options 
Good day sir 
The classic shades 
230 040 
35 400 
Where's your mommy 
Mommy's not home 
Tell her I have to speak to her 
Mommy's not here 
Why have you come 
I went to your sister's yesterday 
Didn't she tell you 
I want nothing more to do with this 
The child is here Go away 
I can't have respect for anyone 
I have to speak to you 
Pricò give me a minute 
The gentleman will be leaving soon 
Go and play in the other room 
But why 
Why 
How can I leave this house 
Agnese 
I'm not going back without you 
I don't care if 
You've gone mad Roberto 
I'm fighting for my life 
And what about mine 
My life is here with my child 
The child was here two years ago 
You said yes to me then 
Didn't you love me 
Didn't you run away with me 
And weren't we happy 
Then why ruin my life now 
Go away 
My baby 
Did you hurit yourself 
I ask your advice because you're so experienced 
My time there was sublime 
That's a little far 
Hotels close to Rome cost the same as in Rome 
What's 200 lire 
But we'd need evening wear and all that 
But that's the whole point 
Perhaps a little elegance is called for 
It is indeed 
Are you working overitime 
Yes 
Idiots 
You're all better now Pricò aren't you 
I'm here sweethearit 
Mommy's always here with you 
Were you frightened 
It's all over now 
Don't say anything to Daddy 
No I won't say anything to him 
END OF PART ONE 
PART TWO 
Hold still just one more second 
Come on no whining 
Don't be afraid 
Get that head underwater 
Did you hear what Daddy said 
She nearly died laughing Dada 
She practically fell into my arms 
I refuse to believe it 
I know Lalla too well 
Come on Bobi 
You've made great progress I see 
Good morning 
Peppi where's my son 
Taking a shower 
Leave me alone 
I'm not coming with you 
And his father always blames me 
No that annoying Nani is here 
Him and his narcissistic ways 
Dada we could have one of our games 
We could offer a prize 
Guess who just got here 
Who 
Tell me 
Mimi 
What a bore 
Good day 
Don't try that with me 
A peach 
You could have come quicker 
I only have two hands 
A peach as pretty as the lady 
There'll be an extra charge 
Fine And some wine 
At your service champion 
Don't count your chickens yet 
The score will be tallied at the end 
Then we'll see who's the champion 
That's a laugh 
I'm always the top dog 
No dialect 
Speak Italian 
I'm number one 
Good for you Federico 
We'll see about that 
Good for you Professor 
Good for the professor 
Always a professor He'll beat the Bolognese 
Let's hear it for the professor 
They're all just jealous 
They're so annoying 
Speak Italian 
I'll show you 
These balls are charmed 
Just a minute Professor 
It's my turn 
Have a nice walk 
Thank you 
May I ask a favor of you 
Of me 
I'd like the madam's address 
What for 
You can tell it to me 
I can't give out her address 
I have very strict orders not to give it out 
To anyone 
All right It doesn't matter 
No we've spent so much already 
So what 
I'm leaving tomorrow 
You can join me later 
It's the inseparable pair 
Please don't get up 
Tomorrow I'm afraid we will be separating 
But that's unacceptable 
A true betrayal 
You're abandoning us so soon 
Duty calls 
But my wife and son are staying 
Your wife is staying 
Will you allow us to take her under our wing 
That's very nice of you 
I'd be honored 
Good day 
Dada the people you befriend 
It's not for me 
One must think of one's friends once in a while 
She's very attractive 
All aboard 
Hands inside please 
All aboard 
I forgot to tip the doorman 
Give him about 30 lire 
I'll take care of it 
Take her on long walks 
See that she rests after lunch 
Take her to the movies just as if I were here 
Good bye darling Think of me 
Of course 
Will you write 
How long will you be in Savona 
Two weeks 
Excuse me miss 
Don't go back there 
Good bye Nina See you soon 
My regards to everyone 
Mr Maritini Mrs Vigo everyone 
Professor Marangoni 
Pricò be a good boy 
After my scientific experiments 
What a bore 
He'll be able to tell if any trick is involved 
See for yourselves 
Don't take my word for it 
What a bore 
A little old fashioned fun can't hurit 
Enjoying yourself ma'am 
Very much 
Please bring your top hats back to the magician 
Go away little boy 
Get out of here 
Good thing I didn't bring my dog 
He'd have torn the pigeons to pieces 
Really 
What did I tell you 
One night I took him 
I took him to a parity at Luciano's 
You can imagine what mayhem ensued 
Dada 
What 
Remember when I took my dog to Luciano's 
I'll bring him one night 
I'm sure you'll love him 
He's such a baby 
I've spoiled him 
I let him get away with murder 
In love too 
I'm very giving 
Nina dance with Mimi 
Giuliana organize a supper for later 
Yes dear 
I have a penthouse in Roma that's so much fun 
Careful Nina 
Mimi's a dangerous man 
You're so silly Dada 
Go on You're wonderful 
I envy you 
You've found some peace 
You don't know what you're saying 
Perhaps it's best this way 
After last night I wrote my office and said 
I'd take my old job back if they'd have me 
I'll go back and work in Genoa 
That's a good idea 
Just a few weeks have erased your memory 
I know you haven't forgotten me 
It's not over between us is it 
Roberito don't toriture me like this 
You said you're leaving Monday 
There's three days left 
Let me see you these three days 
They'll fly by 
Then we'll leave it to God's will 
But for now let me 
I love you Nina 
I love you 
This is better Hold on 
Here 
Why aren't you at the beach 
Are you sick 
No Mommy didn't take me 
Want to come play with me 
I'm bored all by myself 
Go play in the garden with Francesco 
Don't forget my words 
I'm dying of love for you 
You're so beautiful with that dark tan 
Whereas I'm red as a lobster 
You've only been here two days 
Your hair's all messed up 
It looks nice like this 
Two hundred lire 
Next 
Step up 
How can I step up 
It's impossible 
Where are you going 
Home to Daddy in Rome 
Whose child is this 
Where's the train for Rome 
Who's there 
What are you doing there 
Go away 
Get out of here 
Get down from there 
Mother of God 
Did you hurit yourself 
Get out of here 
Did you hurit yourself 
Go away

The poor man

What a terrible blow for a child 
Go on 
Go to your mother 
Go to Mommy 
BAGHDAD IN THE DAYS OF THE MONGOL INVASION 
O Mighty Khan The city is ours 
And the Caliph 
Find him 
O Mighty Caliph 
My defeat is heavy upon me Cassim 
Tell me where have you taken my son 
Ali is safely hidden in my own house 
Then let us go quickly 
With him I go to Basra to raise another army 
You go up against the Mongols a second time 
They are powerful enemies my Lord 
I will avenge my men who died this day 
My Lord perhaps 
Other ways might be found 
Other ways 
Your meaning is not clear 
If you will say the word Caliph 
Terms 
Blood runs in the streets of Baghdad My Lord 
Yours is the counsel of a coward Prince Cassim 
Forgive me 
Come take me to my son 
Mamoud knows the way 
You have served me well Prince Cassim 
Then you shall have your reward 
Lady Amara 
Lady Amara 
Quick 
Out of your beds at this hour 
In a moment we will come Nilah 
In a moment I said 
In a moment In a moment 
Now before she changes her mind again 
There it is done 
But I'm afraid You cannot be afraid now 
The blood of a Caliph flows in your arm 
I'm afraid I'm going to be sick 
I'm alright now Ali 
We are pledged now Amara 
Now we shall never be apart 
Father 
Father 
My son 
Ali we sail to Basra tonight 
Ali 
Father 
Ali you said that we would never part 
But you said 
I said we would never be apart 
So my little son grows into a man 
Ali 
Yes Father 
Yes Father 
I will never fail you or Baghdad 
My Lord 
Come ashore 
Come ashore at once 
Something has happened Turn back Mahmoud 
Turn back 
It may be a trick my Lord 
Turn back 
Turn back 
Quickly over the side 
The Caliph of Baghdad 
You did not lie 
Mighty Khan will reward you greatly 
And the boy 
Where is the boy 
He must have drowned 
Fire the boats 
Close oh Sesame 
Sesame 
Sesame 
Sesame 
Sesame 
Close Sesame 
Open oh Sesame 
Baba 
We've caught a mouse 
Allah defend us 
Another move and you'll die 
Spare me little master 
Here I lay in the dust before you 
Oh pity 
Let me go free and I'll spare him 
The lad has spirit 
I'll split his ears 
Cut him up in little pieces 
Put him down I say 
This is no time forjesting 
The boy knows the secret of our cave 
Then kill him 
No 
It is best we keep him with us 
I join no band of thieves 
But I will lead you against the Mongols 
The little mouse shall lead us 
The boy speaks like a king 
I wear the Seal of Baghdad 
By Allah the boy speaks the truth 
You are the cleverest thief among us 
I am no thief The Seal belongs to me 
The Caliph is dead 
He was betrayed by Prince Cassim 
Now do you believe me 
Now will you follow me 
We have no love for the Mongols 
Eh my men 
Me Abdullah 
The boy will never whimper 
And should he go hungry you will starve 
Should he suffer you will be disembowelled 
Now I'm a nursemaid 
If Allah had granted me a son 
I'd have wished him in your image 
No my name is Ali 
You are welcome Ali Baba 
Ali Baba 
Ali Baba 
AND SO FAR TEN YEARS THE MONGOLS HELD BAGHDAD 
AND THE PEOPLE DIED IN AGONY 
AND ONLY THE BAND OF THIEVES MADE RESISTANCE 
10 000 PIECES OF GOLD FOR THE BODY OF ALI BABA 
AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BAND OF THIEVES 
Ride high ride high 
Ride 
Ride 
Wrong or right Plundering sons 
Thundering sons Forty and one for all 
All for one 
Bedouins all Bedouins all 
Side by side Saddle and ride 
Saddle and ride Following sons of one 
Swift and sure Robbing the rich 
Feeding the poor 
Ride high ride 
Guide me right to a caravan 
Ride again Ali Baba men 
Ride high ride high ride 
Ride of delight following one son of the sun 
Forty and one for all 
Following one son of the sun 
Forty and one for all 
Open oh Sesame 
Baba Baba 
Where did you see such a caravan 
Camped beside the Pool of Midnight 
They bring wedding gifts from Basra 
The betrothed of the Mighty Khan 
By Allah that is a prize worth taking 
It is all ours for the asking 
Treasure like that is well guarded 
No wait We must not rush headlong into danger 
Surely Ali does not object without reason 
My son let's hear your counsel 
Remember there is a price on our heads 
Aye 10 000 pieces of gold 
You speak wisdom my son 
Then let us move with caution 
Now we let it go for fear of shadows 
Ten years Still the nursemaid 
I'm a prisoner in my own caravan 
Such was the order of Hulagu Khan my Lady 
But why 
You forget I am not yet Queen of Baghdad 
Besides who is there to see me here 
A few old camel drivers and a handful of guards 
It is not ours to question my Lady 
Yes my Lady 
You have lived at the court of Baghdad 
Tell me what is the Khan really like 
He is magnificent my Lady 
He rules the world 
He is the greatest warrior in all the land 
Ali Baba is greater 
The water is clear and blue and very cool 
Attract the attention of the guards Jamiel 
Give me your clothes 
But the order of the Khan 
Hulagu Khan is not yet my master 
Your clothes 
Wait here I will signal 
Hello 
Where are you 
I'm curious to see you 
I feed on the curiosity of foolish men 
An evil genii in the pool 
I know the ways of mischief 
Come out and let me see you 
A confection of the gods 
Are you among the men in the caravan 
I haven't seen you before 
Nay I am alone 
That's not possible 
We carry the betrothed of Hulagu Khan 
Now go away and let me dress 
Very much like any other woman 
Some find her beautiful 
1 000 pieces of gold 
That's not enough My price is high 
My mistress awaits my coming 
She's the betrothed of Hulagu Khan 
Return to your mistress then 
But know I shall come to you under the stars 
And some day I will buy you for my very own 
Wait 
Tell me 
Would I be safe in your caravan 
Is it well guarded 
It is not guarded at all 
Who indeed 
What are you 
Abdullah 
It's a trap 
Ride for your life 
My Lady You are not harmed 
Are you alright 
I'm safe 
Woman of the Mongols Traitor 
Well 
We lost him he was too far ahead 
One poor thief 
It is a small catch 
But we'll take him back to Baghdad 
Yes my Lady 
What will they do to the thief 
Can we not find some way to help him 
We must take care my Lady 
Somehow see to it that he does not thirst 
Is one permitted to curse that mangy thief 
Dog of a thief Ignominious son of a camel 
Filthy scum Why you 
The ride across the desert will be very hot 
Here is water for your parched lips 
Allah be with you 
O Mighty Khan 
Ruler of the World Master of the Universe 
My daughter Lady Amara 
Nalu you may go 
We must face facts 
That's why I have kept you in Basra 
Now that my dream is about to be realized 
I will not see it shattered 
And if I refuse to marry the Khan 
Why not accept conditions as they are Amara 
That choice is easy 
Amara 
Does all this mean nothing to you 
The wealth of the world shall be yours Amara 
Your slightest whims shall be commands 
The Khan calls for you Prince Cassim 
See how the thongs cut his flesh Cassim 
A thief bleeds as any other man 
And the hatred in his eyes 
Shall I trust the enemy of my people 
Or the murderer of the Caliph 
Who are you 
I'm the sword hanging over your head 
I know how to deal with these men of Baghdad 
I will wring the secret from him 
Splendid 
The Royal Seal of Baghdad 
On your knees before it you traitor 
I begin to see now 
You were not drowned 
You are Ali Ali Baba the thief 
Ali the son of Hassan 
Hassan is dead Speak no more of him 
His memory lives and I will avenge his death 
By noon tomorrow you will be dead 
Nay 
He dies tomorrow 
What is that to me 
You would not let him die cursing your name 
He thinks it was you who led him into this trap 
What would you have me do 
You could have a word with the prisoner 
Are you mad 
The thief is a follower of Ali Baba 
Is he not worthy of your comfort 
He's a fool to die for a lost cause 
Should he then live a slave 
You will come my Lady Please 
Beloved of the 
What does that matter 
Hundreds die in Baghdad every day 
Why should one more matter 
And that one a thief 
of anyone 
Must you torture me with your lies 
Why come to the marketplace to lie to a thief 
Why indeed 
Again you come before me with evil tidings 
Again you tell me these robbers have escaped 
I send troops there I send an expedition here 
I set traps for them And what happens 
They disappear into thin air O Mighty One 
Craven liar The truth is not in you 
And to steal the betrothed of Hulagu Khan 
Their heads or yours 
We must take him back into the cave Ali 
A little wine Old Baba It will strengthen you 
My strength is spent 
You will live to ride with us again Old Baba 
Many times 
You will ride again my son 
Without you to lead us we will never triumph 
For 10 years you have led this band 
Now we are loved and honored 
You tire yourself Old Baba 
There are things I must say before I leave you 
Return to Baghdad my son 
You cannot escape your destiny 
Avenge your father and free your people 
They must throw off the tyrant 
Remember Abdullah you are still his nursemaid 
Forty and one for all 
Allah be with you my son 
What was he doing there 
Following our trail 
I am no spy 
Release him 
You brought me water when I was a prisoner 
And your knife saved my life in the marketplace 
Why 
Why did you do these things 
Why should you be willing to die for Ali Baba 
Let me join your band 
Are we a wandering tribe of nomads 
Do we collect lazy desert rats as we go 
Desert rats did you say Abdullah 
By the Prophet I'll slice him to little pieces 
Your choice 
Sharp aren't they 
I'll let you go this time 
Abdullah The terror of Baghdad 
You're very clever with your knives 
But how do I know you've not come from the Khan 
Set me a task that I may prove it 
Think you can trust him Ali 
You can trust me as you can trust your own eyes 
I will not fail you Ali Baba 
Are you well known in Baghdad 
Aye I can move freely within the gates 
No one will question me 
The Khan 
Aye 
I shall return him his bride 
Now we buy traitors in the open market 
A female beauty for the grand vizier 
We will await them there 
They'll set a trap for us Ali 
Then we shall post sentries to warn us 
Go and Allah be with you 
Abdullah bring the girl 
Men On to the house of the traitor Cassim 
Close oh Sesame 
Why have you brought me here 
And if all doesn't go well 
Why don't you kill me and be done with it 
What have your demands to do with me 
That's not yours to question 
Where are you going 
Is one permitted to go into one's own gardens 
Yes 
Why do you give her all this freedom 
I shall be queen in Baghdad 
Why are you suddenly so kind and gentle 
My memory is long 
Strange that Ali Baba should speak of dreams 
A man without his dreams withers and grows old 
Aye 
The moonlight was reflected on the water 
As it is reflected in your eyes now 
There it is done 
Call out the guards Surround the palace 
What does it say 
To the Read it 
To the Mongol Dog We will bargain with you 
Your betrothed is our prisoner In exchange 
Read it Read it I say 
In exchange we want Cassim 
Cassim who betrayed the Caliph 
Otherwise she dies 
It is signed with the mark of Ali Baba 
Can we not send soldiers to the estate 
This may be our chance to capture the thieves 
He is no fool he will watch for every trick 
Shall it be your life or hers 
Cassim does not come 
He does not come Why do we wait 
Vengeance for Old Baba Remember our pledge 
Listen 
Why do you want to kill me 
To avenge the death of our Old Baba 
What is the death of your Old Baba to me 
A life for a life that is our law 
Silence 
Have I given you nothing in the past years 
Fighting and snarling like a pack of curs 
The men are tired of waiting 
I've made my decision 
Then let me carry it out for you 
No Jamiel shall do it 
I Ali Baba 
You begged to follow me Jamiel 
Ask anything else of me anything but this 
Do as I say There's no better way to serve me 
Coward You would force my own slave to 
Take her back to the Khan alive 
Alive 
But our message to the Khan Our pledge 
Now I break my pledge 
Why must you weaken now 
Whatever my reason she goes free 
You have heard my decision 
If you want me to leave the band 
I will go 
Then I will fight you for her life 
Send her away if you must 
We cannot quarrel with you over a woman 
Now take her back to Baghdad 
Now will you tell us why you spared her 
It will go on forever 
Your horses are waiting Prince Cassim 
By hard riding you can still arrive by noon 
Great Khan for years I have served you 
How do we know he will keep his word 
Thieves do not keep their bargains 
Ali Baba will slay Amara and then kill me 
Have mercy Mighty Khan Have mercy 
You are a breed apart 
Take him away 
Mighty One 
Father 
Amara 
Father 
Come here 
I cannot explain it 
But he bargained for the life of your father 
For the life of my father 
Why should he seek to kill you 
I saw how he hated you in the marketplace 
What is it between you and this Ali Baba 
Speak 
Father 
This Ali Baba is 
Ali son of the Caliph 
Ali 
You told me he was drowned 
We never found him 
How do you know he's the son of Hassan 
Why didn't you tell me then 
But he lives 
Why did you not tell me 
You knew we were pledged 
So 
They pledged themselves as children 
But the pledge still burns in his heart 
And it is stronger than his hate of me 
Our marriage will go on as planned 
You do us great honor 
No It will not go on 
I cannot marry him now 
And you can't force me to 
Now now Amara I think only of your happiness 
You know how much that pledge meant to me 
We will talk of this later Amara No 
Oh Mighty Khan You have power and wealth 
I can make you a queen 
I can give you silks jewels wealth and power 
Once I was confused I see clearly now 
Too clearly 
Be gentle with her she's wild and headstrong 
This has been a great shock 
Did you find Jamiel 
Yes my Lady 
My Lady 
Come 
Look 
Cut him down from the rack and 
I'll marry you 
Only release him and I'll do anything you ask 
We shall be wed on the Festival of Ramadan 
It will be a great holiday 
You are a master of trickery Prince Cassim 
Leave me 
The horses are ready my Lady 
I cannot go Jamiel 
But now that you know who Ali Baba really is 
I have given my word 
I will marry him at the Feast of Ramadan 
It will be a great holiday 
But what of Ali Baba 
Go to him Jamiel 
He will come to your rescue 
No he must not 
Go quickly 
The slave Jamiel leaves the Palace my Lord 
You see mighty Khan I'm still useful to you 
Tell me of your lady 
She learned from Prince Cassim who you are 
Then why does she marry the Khan 
She thought you were dead 
I will go to her 
Why all this fuss about one woman 
Never never for a woman 
I will go with you Ali Baba 
What 
What do you possess a magic carpet 
When will the wedding be held 
At the Feast of Ramadan 
There will be many guests at the wedding 
One more will pass unnoticed 
Good 
This is the hour for which we have waited 
You're right This is our hour 
Dress your ugly bodies to deceive the Mongols 
This time we enter the palace 
You must return to Baghdad ahead of us 
As Caliph of all Baghdad I bow to you 
Now all of Baghdad shall know 
Abdullah you'd be a favorite in any harem 
Who do you see you ill mannered little ape 
Why Abdullah of course 
Now whom do you see 
Who am I supposed to see 
I'm disguised 
Who are you 
You are a stranger among us 
Truly I have never laid eyes on you before 
It's a wonderful disguise isn't it 
It is black magic 
Wait 
We must find some other way 
We will fool no one with our disguises 
Even a blind Mongol would know us 
My Lady 
I must talk to Lady Amara Quickly 
Go please 
Why have you returned against my orders 
Because of Ali Baba 
He bids you have courage He will come 
No he must not try to save me They'd kill him 
The Mongols would welcome an attack 
There will be wedding gifts brought to Baghdad 
She was spying on you my Lady 
No no I came only to bring my Lady's dress 
We can trust her 
It grows late 
Today Ali Baba comes Ali Baba 
Today 
Ali Baba comes today Ali Baba 
You must challenge everyone 
Take no chances 
I have spies everywhere 
Gifts for the Mighty Khan 
Pass on 
Tell all Baghdad 
Whose caravan is this 
It is mine 
I am Abu Radi merchant of Basra 
What is inside these jars 
Oil 
Oil for the Khan 
If he uncovers the jar he dies 
It is a gift to celebrate the wedding 
Pass on 
O Mighty Khan Haidar Prince of El Samrah 
Precious sapphires and topaz 
Garnets and bloodstone 
Abu Radi merchant of Basra 
In all the land there is no finer oil 
I have waited for this moment

Excellent Cassim excellent

Seize him

All his kith and kin were dead 
We felt so sorry for him

If you'll excuse us for a moment Jonathan 
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere 
Where do we go from here 
You know we got to think fast 
We got to find someplace 
We got to find someplace for Mr Spenalzo too 
Don't waste any worry on that rat 
But we got a hot stiff on our hands 
Forget Mr Spenalzo 
You shouldn't have killed him 
Besides he said I looked like Boris Karloff

What are we going to do 
What would the neighbors think 
What are we going to do about Mr Hoskins 
Mr Hoskins 
It can't be very comfortable for him in there 
And he's been so patient the poor dear 
General Goethals was very pleased

You stood me up 
What happened to him 
Nothing 
I see 
Did that really happen in a play you saw 
How do you like that 
You can't trust nobody 
They practically stole that from my play 
Yeah sure 
You've got to hear the plot 
My mother's making up 
That's the first scene 
My mother doesn't say they're married 
That's the surprise 
What a kick 
Twenty five years pass 
Well in the meantime there's me 
Growing into a magnificent specimen 
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry see 
I'm in great danger 
It's getting you ain't it 
I can see it in your eyes 
You ain't heard nothing yet 
All of a sudden a fire breaks out 
What an effect 
Firemen rush in and who's leading them 
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia 
What's the matter with him 
Probably your play put him to sleep 
What 
I personally like it very much 
It's probably over his head 
Where have I seen that face before 
No please 
The scene changes 
It's an evolving stage 
There's a vacant house on the corner 
Johnny the cops 
Come in 
Hello boys 
What the Sam Hill's going on 
Sarge this is Mortimer Brewster 
He's going to help me write my play 
Do you have to tie him up 
Report in Why didn't you ring in 
The whole force is out looking for you 
No we came to warn the old ladies 
He says we've got to put him away someplace 
Now who the heck is this 
That's the one that ran away So he came back 
Brophy Get me Mac 
Have you got yourself in a mess 
You're two hours overdue at the station 
I better let them know that I found you 
It wasn't that bad was it 
At the Brewster house 
Shall we bring him in 
All right we'll hold him right here 
The Lieutenant is on his way over 
So I've been turned in 
All right you've got me 
Yes reward 
Now I'll do some turning in 
Wait a minute Mr Brewster 
Well there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar 
Yes 13 
I'll show them to you 
Don't make trouble for them 
Never mind Mr Brewster Leave him to me 
Come down to the cellar Wait a minute 
Well look do I have to 
Maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar 
Go on down the cellar with him 
Go on down the cellar with him 
Do I have to

Sarge

Look out 
Fight 
Go on and fight 
That's enough that's enough Everybody off

I got something better 
Let me tell you 
I'll see you later 
The papers are all signed What do I care 
Go ahead fight 
Telephone 
I'll get every one of you 
I hate cops 
I'll brain the first one that comes near me 
Don't do that please 
Get him Pat 
That won't have any effect 
I've tried it before 
It did Isn't that amazing 
Oh dear Wish I could relax like that 
What has occurred 
Never mind 
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this 
Well Lieutenant 
We were just acting in self defense 
What happened He put up a fight 
This isn't the one who blows the bugle 
This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara 
All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff 
Boris 
Turn him over 
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere 
You kind of think he's wanted somewhere 
Certainly he's wanted 
In Indiana 
That's my brother 
Why'd you knock him out 
Thanks pal 
About my not ringing in I want to 
Where have you been all night 
Don't tell me 
You're going to have a long time on that play 
You're suspended 
Now go on 
Report in 
The guy who helped him escape He's wanted too 
Here 
With flatheads like you on the force 
Falling for a story like that 
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar 
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar 
Who are you 
I'm President Roosevelt 
What the blazes is this 
He's the one that blows the bugle 
Howdy Colonel 
Colonel you've blown your last bugle 
Get this guy out of here 
Dear me 
Another yellow fever victim 
No Colonel 
This is a spy We caught him at the White House 
Questioning of spies is my department 
Hey you keep out of that 
Who are you 
What's your name 
You're his brother Look no argument 
He's got to be put away 
No arguments Captain 
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle 
And that cockeyed story about 13 bodies being 
I know just how you feel 
There's people dumb enough to believe that 
What's this 
What's the matter 
These papers aren't any good 
Why not 
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt 
Is your taxi engaged 
Losing dough every minute Any offers 
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse 
We like to think of it as a rest home 
Mr Brewster 
Mr Witherspoon is here 
No it's chicanery 
What is this 
Come on 
He's come to 
He's ready to talk Hold him till I get there 
Code for Roosevelt 
Take the name Brewster 
Take away the B and what have you got 
And what does a rooster do 
Where do you hunt in Africa 
On the veldt 
Ingenious 
That's all right Do that again for me 
Never mind 
Give me that pen 
This is fun 
Now all I got to get is Witherspoon 
I'm so glad to see you 
You will take good care of Teddy 
Best of care of him That's fine 
And no wagon when he leaves 
Why 
To take him away 
Never never 
Taxicabs 
We always 
I have one waiting now 
It means a great deal to me 
You do 
It must be a nice place I've never been there 
You never can tell 
A pamphlet about Happy Dale 
No it's a play 
Something I've been working on 
Captain 
Captain 
I want you to read this carefully 
I want you to be just as harsh as you like 
I shan't mind you know 
Captain this is Mr Witherspoon 
Come my boy 
What is this 
No you got it wrong This is Captain Rooney 
The police 
I'm sure 
Here are the papers all signed 
Now you can take him away 
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills 
Mr President I have good news for you 
Your term of office is over 
Is this March 4 
Practically 
Let's see 
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa 
Well I must get started immediately

Taft 
Bully 
Bully 
Wait right here I'll bring down my equipment 
Happy man 
Goodbye Aunt Abby Aunt Martha 
I'm on my way to Africa Isn't it wonderful 
Charge 
It's all right I've got it 
Oh dear 
And Happy Dale is full of staircases 
You've come to meet Teddy haven't you 
No he's come to take him 
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again 
No he can't go now We won't permit it 
We promise to take his bugle away from him 
We won't be separated from Teddy I'm sorry 
How can you allow this 
You promised 
Brewster's got nothing to do with this 
The law is the law 
Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go 
If he's going we're going too 
Yes you'll have to take us with him 
Why not Why not indeed 
It's sweet of them but impossible 
You could arrange that 
Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up 
Too dangerous Dissension jealousy 
Now let's be sensible ladies 
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar 
Our cellar 
There are 13 bodies in our cellar 
What 
Yes 
You just ask our nephew Mortimer 
Charge 
Isn't that amazing 
You behave yourself 
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar 
What is this 
You mustn't mind Mortimer 
How about it 
I'll be right there 
He's been a little strange all day 
I'll look in that cellar 
I'll tell you what we'll do 
We put flowers on them every Sunday Flowers 
Sure I put neon lights on mine 
Humor them humor them 
Smile 
There's one down there a Mr Spenalzo 
Hasn't got it yet 
who doesn't belong here and has to leave 
But the other 12 are our gentlemen 
Your gentlemen 
There is a Happy Dale far far away 
There is a Happy 
He got it 
It's amazing 
Just the ladies 
Just the ladies 
How about it 
They'd have to be committed 
Teddy committed himself Couldn't they 
All they have to do is sign the papers 
If we can go with Teddy we'll sign the papers 
Where are they 
I have them ladies right here 
Sign them up will you 
I want this all cleaned up 
Thirteen bodies in the cellar 
Ladies if you'll sign right here

Pop eyes 
Talks with a German accent 
Poses as a doctor 
Okay Mac Thanks

But Dr Einstein 
It's contagious yes It's your turn 
Don't play games

Mine 
You see you signed as next of kin 
What's wrong about that darling 
Martha you tell him

You're not really a Brewster 
What 
Your mother came to us as a cook 
And you were born about three months afterwards 
So brother married her 
Your real father was a cook too 
He was a chef on a tramp steamer 
You mean I'm not really a Brewster 
Darling 
Don't feel so badly about it 
I'm sure it won't make any difference to Elaine 
Where are you 
Can you hear me 
I'm not really a Brewster 
I'm the son of a sea cook 
It's true I saw them 
It's true 
It's true 
There are 13 bodies down there 
But I saw them 
What's all this screaming about 
But I saw them It's way past her bedtime 
Quiet 
But Mortimer 
Goodbye

Charge

I'm a coffeepot 
Hello there Mr Neff 
Working pretty late aren't you Mr Neff 
Late enough Let's ride

I'm fine 
How's the insurance business Mr Neff 
Okay 
Uh huh 
I say it's rheumatism

Office memorandum 
Walter Neff to Barton Keyes Claims Manager 
Los Angeles July 16th 1938 
Dear Keyes: 
I don't like the word confession 
Accident and Double Indemnity 
You said it wasn't an accident Check 
You said it wasn't suicide Check 
You said it was murder 
Check 
You thought you had it cold didn't you 
Want to know who killed Dietrichson 
Hold tight to that cheap cigar of yours Keyes 
I killed Dietrichson 
Until a little while ago that is 
Yes I killed him 
Pretty isn't it 
It began last May 
About the end of May it was 
So I decided to run over there 
Mr Dietrichson in 
Who wants to see him 
The name is Neff Walter Neff 
If you're selling something 
Listen Mr Dietrichson's not in 
How soon do you expect him 
What is it Nettie 
Who is it 
It's for Mr Dietrichson 
I'm Mrs Dietrichson 
What is it How do you do Mrs Dietrichson 
Pacific all what 
but he's never at his office 
Is there anything I can do 
The insurance ran out on the fifteenth 
Perhaps I know what you mean Mr Neff 
I've just been taking a sun bath 
No pigeons around I hope 
That's all right 
Nettie show Mr Neff into the living room 
Where would the living room be 
In there but they keep the liquor locked up 
That's okay I always carry my own keys 
I wasn't long was I 
Not at all Mrs Dietrichson 
I hope I've got my face on straight 
It's perfect for my money 
Neff is the name isn't it 
What story 
The Philadelphia Story 
My husband never tells me anything 
That would be fine with me 
No the All Risk Mrs Dietrichson Why 
Do they have a better rate 
If your husband's a member 
No he isn't 
The Automobile Club is fine 
I've had 11 years of it 
Doing pretty well 
It's a living 
Accident insurance 
Accident insurance 
Sure Mrs Dietrichson 
Just my name 
As for instance 
Phyllis 
Phyllis I think I like that 
But you're not sure 
He'll be in then 
Who 
How fast was I going officer 
I'd say about 90 
Suppose I let you off with a warning this time 
Suppose it doesn't take 
Suppose I have to whack you over the knuckles 
That tears it 
Eight thirty tomorrow evening then 
That's what I suggested 
Will you be here too 
I guess so I usually am 
Same chair same perfume same anklet 
I wonder if I know what you mean 
I wonder if you wonder 
But I didn't I felt like a million 
Here park these for me sweetheart 
You're in a jam and you know it 
Sez you All I want is my money 
Sez you All you're gonna get is the cops 
Sure I know Mr Gorlopis 
Wrote a policy on his truck 
How are you Mr Gorlopis 
I ain't so good My truck burned down 
Yeah 
Because my little man tells me 
What little man 
The little man in here 
So what did I do 
And what did they find 
They found what was left of a pile of shavings 
What shavings 
That's one way of putting it 
I ain't feelin' so good Mr Keyes 
Sign this and you'll feel fine 
Sign what Right there 
It's a waiver on your claim 
But I ain't got no more truck 
$2600 That's a lot of dough where I live 
Don't you know how to open the door 
pull it toward you that's the boy 
Thank you Mr Keyes 
What kind of an outfit is this anyway 
writing a policy on a mugg like that 
Wait a minute Keyes I don't rate this beef 
The way they don't do things 
I've had 26 years of that and I 
And you loved every minute of it Keyes 
I love you too 
You never fooled me not for a second 
She didn't want me to come tomorrow evening 
Hello Mr Neff Aren't you coming in 
I'm considering it 
Last night wasn't so convenient 
You did 
Yes He'll renew with you he told me so 
In fact I thought he'd be here this afternoon 
But he's not 
No 
That's terrible 
Nettie 
 
Nettie 
Oh I forgot it's the maid's day off 
Nevermind the beer ice tea will be fine 
Lemon Sugar 
Fix it your way 
Like running the vacuum cleaner 
Fresh 
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners 
Not much money but you learn a lot about life 
Where did you pick up this tea drinking 
You're not English are you 
No Californian 
Born right here in Los Angeles 
They say native Californians all come from Iowa 
Mr Neff I 
Make it Walter 
Walter 
Right 
20% Why 
I can always use it 
I was thinking about my husband 
It's very dangerous 
Not for an executive is it 
He doesn't just sit behind a desk 
Please don't talk like that 
But that's the idea 
He's in the hospital with a broken back 
It's bad 
It's got me jittery just thinking about it 
It could 
What kind of insurance could he have 
Enough to cover doctors' and hospital bills 
Capital sum 
What's that 
In case he gets killed 
Maybe I shouldn't have said that 
Your husband would understand 
Why don't I talk to him about it 
You could try But he's pretty tough going 
They're all tough at first 
He's got a lot on his mind 
Sounds pretty dull 
So I just sit and knit 
Is that what you married him for 
Anytime his thumbs get tired 
with me around you wouldn't have to knit 
Wouldn't I 
I bet your life you wouldn't 
I want to ask you something Walter 
How's that again 
I have a little allowance of my own 
Why shouldn't he know 
Because he doesn't want accident insurance 
He's superstitious about it 
A lot of people are 
Funny isn't it 
You see what I mean Walter Sure 
I've got good eyesight 
That's the set up isn't it 
Is there anything wrong with it 
No I think it's lovely 
What crown block 
I don't know what you're talking about 
Are you crazy 
Not that crazy 
Goodbye Mrs Dietrichson 
What's the matter 
Look baby you can't get away with it 
You want to knock him off don't you 
That's a horrible thing to say 
Who'd you think I was anyway 
You got one that's been around too long 
I think you're rotten 
Get out of here 
You bet I'll get out of here baby 
I'll get out of here but quick 
So I let her have it straight between the eyes 
She didn't fool me for a minute not this time 
That didn't help me either 
It was only the beginning 
Hello You forgot your hat this afternoon 
Did I 
Don't you want me to bring it in 
Sure 
Put it on the chair 
How did you know where I live 
It's in the phone book 
It's raining 
Yeah 
Peel off your coat and sit down 
Your husband out 
He phoned he'd be late About 9:30 
I knew you wouldn't leave it like that 
Like what 
Like it was this afternoon 
Okay 
It's not okay Not if you don't believe me 
What do you want me to do 
I want you to be nice to me 
Like the first time you came to the house 
It can't be like the first time 
Something has happened 
I know it has 
It's happened to us 
He's in Long Beach isn't he 
Relax 
Maybe I oughtn't to have come 
Maybe you oughtn't 
You want me to go 
If you want to 
Right now 
Sure Right now 
I'm crazy about you baby 
I'm crazy about you Walter 
I don't know I bought it down at Ensenada 
But all I have is bourbon 
Bourbon is fine Walter 
Get a couple of glasses will you 
Soda 
Plain water please 
Who didn't 
His wife 
Perhaps it was worth it to her 
A colored woman comes in twice a week 
Cook your own breakfast 
I squeeze a grapefruit once in a while 
The rest I get at the corner drugstore 
It sounds wonderful 
Just strangers beside you 
You don't know them You don't hate them 
What daughter 
Oh that little girl on the piano Mmm 
Lola She lives with us 
He thinks a lot more of her than he does of me 
Ever think of a divorce 
He wouldn't give me a divorce 
I suppose because it would cost him money 
But he had when you married him 
Yes he had 
And I wanted a home Why not 
But that wasn't the only reason 
When she died he was all broken up 
I pitied him so 
And now you hate him 
Yes Walter He's so mean to me 
He won't let me go anywhere 
That Lola 
Nothing for you at all huh 
No And nothing is just what I'm worth to him 
Walter I don't want to kill him I never did 
Not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face 
Only sometimes you wish he was dead 
Perhaps I do 
Is that it 
Perhaps that too 
We have a guy in our office named Keyes 
In 3 minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident 
But Walter I didn't and I'm not going to do it 
They know more tricks than a carload of monkeys 
And I don't want you to hang baby 
Stop thinking about it will you 
And you know every notch in it by heart 
Look Keyes I'm not trying to whitewash myself 
Will you phone me 
Walter 
Sure I believe you 
You're not going to hang baby 
It's better than going on this way 
Do you know what you're saying 
Sure I know what I'm saying 
Walter you're hurting me 
There isn't going to be any slip up 
Nothing sloppy Nothing weak 
It's got to be perfect 
Call me tomorrow 
But not from your house From a booth 
And watch your step Every single minute 
Straight down the line 
That was it Keyes 
I was trying to think with your brains Keyes 
A couple of nights later I went to the house 
Who needs a hat in California 
Just as you say 
Sure 
Phyllis mind if we don't finish this game 
It bores me stiff 
Got some thing better to do 
Yes I have 
Father is it all right if I run along now 
Run along where 
Who with 
Just Anne We're going roller skating 
Anne who 
Anne Matthews 
It's not that Nino Zachetti again 
It's Anne Matthews I told you 
I also told you we're going roller skating 
And I'm late already 
I hope that is all clear Father 
Good night Phyllis 
Good night Miss Dietrichson 
Oh I'm sorry 
Good night Mr 
 
Neff 
Good night Mr Neff 
A great little fighter for her weight 
Now if you just sign these Mr Dietrichson 
Sign what 
The applications for your auto renewals 
When will that be 
In about a week 
Just so I'm covered when I drive up North 
San Francisco 
Palo Alto 
He was a Stanford man Mr Neff 
What's wrong with that 
Can't I have a little fun even once a year 
Great football school Stanford 
Did you play football Mr Dietrichson 
Left guard Almost made the varsity too 
Where do I sign 
Bottom line 
Both copies please 
Sign twice huh 
One is the agent's copy I need it for my files 
Files Duplicates Triplicates 
Thank you Mr Dietrichson 
How much you taking me for 
One forty seven fifty 
Plenty 
Bring me some soda when you come up Phyllis 
Good night Mr Neff 
Good night Mr Dietrichson 
Good night Mr Neff 
All right Walter 
Fine 
He signed it didn't he 
Sure he signed it You saw him 
End of the month 
He drives huh 
He always drives 
Why 
It means they pay double on certain accidents 
The kind that almost never happen 
Like for instance if a guy got killed on a train 
they'd pay a $100 000 instead of $50 000 
I see 
Straight down the line 
Hello Mr Neff 
It's me 
Anything wrong 
I've been waiting for you 
For me 
Why 
Which way would that be 
Down the hill Down Vermont 
Oh sure Vermont and Franklin 
North west corner wasn't it 
Be glad to Miss Dietrichson 
Roller skating eh 
You like roller skating 
I can take it or leave it 
Only tonight you're leaving it 
Yes I am 
I'm having a very tough time at home 
That does sound tough all right 
That's why I have to lie sometimes 
You mean it's not Vermont and Franklin 
It's Vermont and Franklin all right 
Only it's not Anne Matthews 
It's Nino Zachetti 
You won't tell on me will you 
I'd have to think it over 
He got behind in his credits and flunked out 
Then he lost his job for talking back 
He's so hot headed 
That comes expensive doesn't it 
I wish he'd see it my way 
I can't give Nino up 
I suppose it will sometime 
This is the corner right here Mr Neff 
Nino Over here Nino 
This is Mr Neff Nino 
Hello Nino 
The name is Zachetti 
Nino Please 
Why does he have to get told about us 
We don't have to worry about Mr Neff Nino 
What's the matter with you Nino 
He's a friend 
I don't have any friends 
And if I did I like to pick them myself C'mon 
Is that anything to get tough about 
Of course I'm coming 
Don't mind him Mr Neff Thanks a lot 
You're awfully sweet 
And what that signature meant 
He was a dead pigeon 
You know that big market up on Los Feliz Keyes 
We had to be very careful from now on 
We couldn't let anybody see us together 
Not from her house or at my office anyway 
Sort of accidentally on purpose 
Walter I 
Not so loud 
I wanted to talk to you ever since yesterday 
Let me talk first 
I got his check too 
I saw him down in the oil fields 
He thought he was paying for the auto insurance 
Quick open your bag 
Can you get into his safe deposit box 
Yes We both have keys 
I'm not a fool 
Okay When is he taking the train 
That's just it He isn't going 
What 
What's happened 
That one up there 
Go ahead I'm listening 
Broke his leg 
What do we do Walter 
Nothing Just wait 
Wait for what 
But we can't wait I can't go on like this 
There are other ways 
Only we're not going to do it other ways 
But we can't leave it like this 
Don't ever talk like that 
Just don't let's start losing our heads 
It's not our heads It's our nerve we're losing 
Excuse me 
We're going to do it right That's all I said 
It's the waiting that's getting me 
Maybe we have Walter 
Only it's so tough without you 
It's like a wall between us 
Then it was the 15th of June 
You may remember that date Keyes 
Hello Keyes 
I just came from Norton's office 
That's twice in a row Congratulations 
Thanks 
How would you like a cheap drink 
How would you like a $50 cut in salary 
Do I laugh now or wait until it gets funny 
I thought that you 
Me 
Why pick on me 
That's crazy all right I'm a salesman 
You're too good to be a salesman 
Nobody's too good to be a salesman 
That'd trouble anybody 
It takes more guts than there is in 50 salesman 
It's the hottest job in the business 
A desk job Is that all you can see in it 
That's not the way I see it Walter 
They're alive 
Who 
Okay hold on a minute 
For a few bucks more a week 
There's a dame on your phone 
Walter Neff speaking 
I had to call you Walter It's terribly urgent 
Are you with somebody 
Yes I am Can't I call you back Margie 
I've only got a minute It can't wait 
Listen He's going tonight On the train 
Are you listening Walter 
Yeah I'm listening Margie 
Only uh make it snappy will you 
The change will do him good 
On the train 
Yeah 
One hundred percent better 
Hold the line will you 
Keyes suppose I join you in your office 
It's alright I'll wait 
Only tell her not to take all day 
Go ahead 
It's the 10:15 from Glendale 
I'm driving him 
Is it still that same dark street isn't it 
The signal is three honks on the horn 
Okay anything else No 
Oh 
What color did you pick 
Blue Navy blue 
And the cast on his left leg 
That suits me fine 
This is it Walter 
I'm shaking like a leaf 
I love you Walter 
Goodbye 
Sorry Keyes 
What's the matter 
The dames chasing you again Or still 
Or is it none of my business 
If I told you it was a customer 
Margie I bet she drinks from the bottle 
Why don't you for instance 
I almost did once A long time ago 
Now look Keyes I've got a call on prospect 
She had a white satin dress with flounces on it 
So you went back and had her investigated 
Yeah And the stuff that came out 
And she already had one husband 
I get the general idea 
All right What am I to say to Norton 
How about that job I want you for 
I don't think I want it Keyes 
Thanks just the same 
Fair enough 
Only get this: 
The time for thinking had all run out 
That was part of the alibi 
This was another item to establish my alibi 
Hiya there Mr Neff 
Hello Charlie 
How about giving the heap a wash 
Okay 
I was being that careful 
I got into the back of the car 
I laid there on the floor and waited 
About ten minutes later they came down 
You all right honey 
Yeah I'm all right 
I'll have the car out in a second 
Take it easy honey We've got lots of time 
Yeah 
Remember what the doctor said 
So what 
What are you doing that for 
What are you honking the horn for 
Don't worry 
I said don't worry Walter 
You start just as soon as the train leaves 
Remember 
I remember everything 
San Francisco train lady 
Car 9 section 11 Just my husband going 
Car 9 section 11 This way please 
Thank you My husband doesn't like to be helped 
Car 9 section 11 Thank you 
Yeah you take it easy driving home 
I'll miss you honey 
Good bye honey 
Good luck honey 
Can you make up my berth right away 
Yes sir 
Right this way sir 
You'd like a chair 
No thanks I'd rather stand 
You going far 
Palo Alto 
Had a broken arm myself once 
I thought I'd go crazy with mine 
I eh used to be 
My cigar case 
No thanks I really prefer cigar 
Maybe the porter could 
Well I could get it for you 
Be glad to Mr Dietrichson 
Car 9 section 11 A pleasure 
Okay This is got to be fast 
Okay baby That's it 
All right let's go 
She dropped me a block from my apartment house 
Walter 
What's the matter 
Aren't you going to kiss me 
It's straight down the line isn't it 
I love you Walter 
I love you baby 
Nobody saw me this time either 
No calls No visitors 
Then I changed my clothes again 
That left one last thing to do 
I had to go down to the garage 
I wanted Charlie to see me again 
Oh It's all right Charlie 
Yes Mr Neff 
That was all there was to it 
I couldn't hear my own footsteps 
It was the walk of a dead man 
I was trying to hold myself together but 
I could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces 
Oh Walter 
Hello Keyes 
Come along the big boss wants to see us 
That Dietrichson case 
Must be 
Anything wrong 
What have you got so far 
Autopsy report 
He died of a broken neck 
When is the inquest 
What do the police figure 
They're satisfied It's not their dough 
Come on Walter 
Please stand by I may need you later 
Come in Mr Keyes You too Mr Neff 
Sit down gentlemen Any new developments 
Who's Jackson 
The last man that saw Dietrichson alive 
Very interesting about the cigar case 
Anything else Not much 
There is a daughter 
I couldn't sell him at first 
He signed the application and gave me his check 
A fine piece of salesmanship that was Mr Neff 
Fall off a train 
Are we sure Dietrichson fell off the train 
I don't get it 
You don't Mr Keyes 
Then what do you think of this case 
This policy might cost us a great deal of money 
No opinion at all 
Nope Not even a hunch 
You know you know what 
I know it was not an accident 
What do you say to that 
Me 
You've got the ball Let's see you run with it 
Yes 
Have her come in please 
I'm having a visitor if you don't mind Oh 
Mrs Dietrichson 
I assure you I appreciate it 
This is Mr Keyes 
How do you do 
How do you do 
And Mr Neff 
I've met Mr Neff How do you do 
Mrs Dietrichson won't you sit down 
May I extend our sympathy in your bereavement 
You know why we asked you to come don't you 
Evidently you don't know that Mrs Dietrichson 
His safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet 
It seems a tax examiner has to be present 
What sort of things 
We have the report of the coroner's inquest 
Accidental death 
We are not entirely satisfied 
In fact 
we are not satisfied at all 
I'm sorry Would you like a glass of water 
Please 
Thank you 
Let us examine this so called accident 
Do what 
Probably still is 
And then he is alone And then he does it 
Does what 
He jumps Suicide 
In which case the company is not liable 
You know that of course 
Now we could go to court 
Don't bother Mr Norton 
In fact I don't like you Mr Norton 
Goodbye gentlemen 
Only you fumbled on the goal line 
I haven't eh 
Can we 
Yeah In the front office 
I've got ten volumes on suicide alone 
Suicide how committed: 
by poisons by fire arms by drowning by leaps 
15 miles an hour 
May I have this 
Come on Walter 
Next time I'll rent a tuxedo 
Hello 
Hello baby 
Sure everything is fine 
You were wonderful in Norton's office 
How do you think I felt baby 
Where are you 
At the drug store Just a block away 
Can I come up 
Okay But be careful Don't let anybody see you 
Hello Keyes 
What's on your mind 
That broken leg 
The guy had a broken leg 
What are you talking about 
Talking about Dietrichson 
He had accident insurance didn't he 
Yeah 
Then he broke his leg didn't he 
So what 
What are you driving at 
Walter I had dinner two hours ago 
It stuck half way 
The little man is acting up again 
Because he didn't file a claim 
Maybe he just didn't have time 
Oh maybe he just didn't know he was insured 
No that couldn't be it 
Yeah 
And you got his check 
Sure I did 
Got any bicarbonate of soda 
No I haven't 
Maybe Norton was right Maybe it was suicide 
No Not suicide 
But not an accident either 
What else 
Look Walter 
Then two weeks later he is killed on a train 
One out of 
I don't know how many billions 
And add to that the broken leg 
Now it just can't be the way it looks 
Something has been worked on us 
Such as what 
Murder 
Don't you have any peppermint or anything 
I'm sorry 
Soda water 
No no no 
Who do you suspect 
The wife 
You're crazy Keyes 
She wasn't even on the train 
I know she wasn't Walter 
Good night Walter 
Good night Keyes 
See you at the office in the morning Yeah 
Not too much 
Have you got one of those things 
Good night Keyes 
So long Walter 
How much does he know 
He doesn't know anything 
It's those stinking hunches of his 
But he can't prove anything can he 
For how long a while 
Until all this dies down 
He'll investigate you He'll have you shadowed 
He'll watch you every minute from now on 
Are you afraid baby 
Yes I'm afraid 
But not of Keyes I'm afraid of us 
We're not the same any more 
What are you talking about 
Shut up baby 
Hello Mr Neff 
Hello 
Lola Dietrichson Don't you remember me 
Yes Of course 
Could I talk to you just for a few minutes 
Somewhere where we can be alone 
Oh Yeah uh 
Come on into my office 
It's about my father's death 
I'm terribly sorry Miss Dietrichson 
It's all yours Walter 
And I had that same feeling once before 
When my mother died 
When your mother died 
We were up at Lake Arrowhead 
That was six years ago We had a cabin there 
She had a nurse with her 
There were just the three of us in the cabin 
She was delirious with fever 
The nurse wasn't in the room 
Just then I heard a door open behind me 
The nurse stood there 
Two days later my mother was dead 
Do you know who that nurse was 
No Who 
Phyllis 
You're not making sense Miss Dietrichson 
Your father fell off a train 
You've had a pretty bad shock Miss Dietrichson 
Aren't you just imagining all this 
That same look 
You don't like your step mother do you 
Isn't it just because she is your step mother 
I loathe her Because she did it 
I'm going to tell everything I know 
I'm not afraid You'll see 
I'm sorry 
I didn't mean to act like this 
All this that you've been telling me 
who else have you told 
No one 
How about your step mother 
Of course not 
I moved out I'm not living at home any more 
I'm not seeing him any more We had a fight 
Where are you living now 
I got myself a little apartment in Hollywood 
Yes Mr Neff 
I wanted to cheer her up 
It was dynamite whether it was true or not 
Come in Come in Walter 
Hello Keyes 
I want to ask you something 
About what 
About me 
It's murder and murders don't come any neater 
Smart and tricky and almost perfect but 
Go ahead I'm listening 
You know what 
That guy Dietrichson was never on the train 
He wasn't 
No he wasn't 
You're way ahead of me Keyes 
Look Walter it was like this 
They killed the guy 
An impersonation see 
And a cinch to work 
Is it 
I tell you it fits together like a watch 
Come in Mr Jackson 
Yes sir Mr Keyes 
These are fine cigars you smoke 
Two for a quarter 
That's what I said 
Did you study those photographs 
Yes indeed 
I studied them thoroughly Very thoroughly 
Did you make up your mind 
Mr Keyes I'm a Medford man Medford Oregon 
Let's have it 
Yes 
Then my answer is no 
What do you mean no 
Will you swear to that 
I'm a Medford man Medford Oregon 
There you are Walter There's your proof 
Oh this is Mr Neff one of our salesmen 
Please to meet you Mr Neff Pleased indeed 
How are you Very fine thank you 
Never was better 
Sit down Mr Jackson 
Dietrichson was about 50 wasn't he Walter 
51 according to the policy 
The man I saw was nothing like 51 years old 
But I'm positive just the same 
Thank you Jackson 
Expenses paid of course 
Of course 
Get me Lubin in the cashier's office 
Hello Lubin This is Keyes 
Oh take care of his hotel will you 
Ever been in Medford Mr Neff 
Never been up there 
Do you go trout fishing 
Maybe I saw you up Klamath Falls way Nope 
I don't fish 
Neff Neff 
It's the name 
There's a family of Neffs in Corvallis 
No relation 
Very reputable man too I'm told 
and the ticket for the train tonight 
Tonight 
Tomorrow morning would suit me better 
Osteopath 
Well just don't put her on the expense account 
Goodbye 
There it is Walter 
He'll show He's got to show 
Sometime somewhere they've got to meet 
Their emotions are all kicked up 
They're stuck with each other 
They'll be digging their own graves 
Mrs Dietrichson 
This is Jerry's market 
Will you be coming by the day 
Thank you Mrs Dietrichson 
Hello Walter 
Come over here 
What's the matter 
Everything's the matter 
Keyes is rejecting your claim 
He wants you to sue But you're not going to 
What's he got to stop me 
He's got plenty 
He's dug up a witness he thinks will prove it 
Prove it how 
If he rejects that claim I have to sue 
Yeah 
What about me and the first Mrs Dietrichson 
The way she died 
I've been seeing her if you want to know 
Keep her out of this 
All I'm telling you is we're not going to sue 
It isn't the money any more It's our necks 
We're pulling out understand 
Because of what Keyes can do 
You're not fooling me Walter 
I said leave her out of this 
We can't go though with it That's all 
We have gone through with it Walter 
Watch it 
I loved you Walter And I hated him 
Is that what you're telling me 
And nobody's pulling out 
It's straight down the line for both of us 
Remember 
Yes I remembered 
And I got to thinking what cemeteries are for 
They're to put dead people in 
I saw Lola 3 or 4 times that week 
Why are you crying 
You won't tell me 
Of course I will Walter 
Zachetti 
What about him 
They killed my father together 
What makes you say that 
It was Phyllis and him all alone 
Maybe he was going with me just for a blind 
And the night of the murder 
You promised not to talk that way any more 
but he never showed up He said he was sick 
Sick 
Phyllis and Zachetti 
What was he doing up at her house 
I couldn't figure that one out 
I tried to make sense out of it and got nowhere 
But the real brain twister came the next day 
Oh Walter just a minute 
Hello Keyes 
Just hang onto your hat Walter 
What for 
How do you mean The guy showed 
That's how 
What guy 
The guy who helped to do it 
The somebody else 
Mm hmm 
Come on I'll buy you a martini 
No thanks Keyes 
With two olives 
Margie I still bet she drinks from the bottle 
So long Walter 
I was scared stiff Keyes 
Maybe you were playing cat and mouse with me 
in your office 
Memo to Mr Norton Confidential 
Dietrichson File 
I disagree absolutely 
Respectfully Barton Keyes 
Phyllis 
Walter 
I've got to see you Tonight 
Yes it has to be tonight 
How's eleven o'clock 
Don't worry about Keyes 
No nobody's watching the house not any more 
It's just for the neighbors 
I told you not to worry about Keyes 
See you eleven o'clock 
Goodbye baby 
Yeah that's what I thought 
In here Walter 
Hello baby 
Anybody else in the house 
Nobody Why 
What's that music 
A radio up the street 
Just like the first time I came here isn't it 
We were talking about automobile insurance 
Only you were thinking about murder 
And I was thinking about that anklet 
And what are you thinking about now 
I'm all through thinking baby 
I Just came to say goodbye 
Goodbye 
Where are you going 
You're the one that's going baby Not me 
All right I tell you 
A friend of mine has got a funny theory 
And the last stop is the cemetery 
Maybe he's got something there 
You bet he has 
Just who are you talking about 
An acquaintance of yours A Mr Zachetti 
I was a sucker 
Nobody wanted to brush you off 
Save it I'm telling this 
That's not true 
And what's happening to me all this time 
Don't be silly baby 
What do you think is going to happen to you 
You helped him do the murder didn't you 
Maybe I'd rather talk 
Sometimes people are where they can't talk 
Under six feet of dirt maybe 
Sure they would 
That's just what's going to happen baby 
With the cops right behind him 
It's all taken care of 
Right 
So we can get that money and be together 
That's cute Say it again 
I made him come back I was working on him 
He's crazy sort of guy quick tempered 
And you know what he'd have done to her 
don't you Walter 
Yeah 
We're both rotten 
Only you're just a little more rotten 
That's the way you operate isn't it baby 
I don't like this music anymore 
Do you mind if I close the window 
You can do better than that can't you baby 
Better try again 
Maybe if I came a little closer 
How's this 
Do you think you can do it now 
Why didn't you shoot again baby 
When I couldn't fire that second shot 
I'm sorry baby I'm not buying 
I'm not asking you to buy Just hold me close 
Goodbye baby 
Come here 
I said come here 
The name is Neff 
Yeah 
And I still don't like it What do you want 
Look kiddo I want to give you a present 
Here's a nice new nickel 
What's the gag 
She isn't worth a nickel 
Tough aren't you 
Take the nickel and call her She wants you to 
She doesn't want any part of me 
I know who told you that and it's not true 
She's in love with you She always has been 
Don't ask me why I couldn't even guess 
Here Granite 0386 go on and call her 
Go on That way 
It's almost 4:30 now Keyes 
It's cold 
except I want to ask you to do me a favor 
so he doesn't get pushed around too much 
Hello Keyes 
Up pretty early aren't you 
Or did your little man pull you out of bed 
The janitor did 
Wouldn't be surprised 
So I gather 
How long have you been standing there 
Long enough 
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy twist to it 
One you didn't quite figure out 
You can't figure them all Walter 
That's right You can't can you 
Walter you're all washed up 
Thanks Keyes That was short anyway 
I'm going to call a doctor 
What for 
So they can patch me up 
Is that it Keyes 
Something like that Walter 
Well I've got a different idea 
Yeah 
Look Keyes 
From then on you can play it any way you like 
Would you do that much for me Keyes 
Give me one good reason 
I need four hours to get where I'm going 
You're not going anywhere Walter 
You bet I am 
I'm going across the border 
You haven't got a chance Walter 
Good enough to try for 
You'll never make the border 
That's what you think 
Watch me 
You'll never even make the elevator 
So long Keyes 
Hello 
Yeah 
It's a police job 
How you doing Walter 
I'm fine 
They're on the way 
You know why you didn't figure this one Keyes 
Let me tell you 
The guy you were looking for was too close 
He was right across the desk from you 
Closer than that Walter 
I love you too 
Stand back 
No Paula Don't look back 
Wouldn't you like that 
No Now look Wait a moment signorina 
Your mind's not on your singing 
Did you never hear your aunt sing Lucia 
You look like her 
But I don't sing like her I know 
Signor Guardi may I speak to you seriously 
Very seriously Maestro 
It is 10 minutes to the hour 
Now what is it you wish to say to me seriously 
Very seriously 
I haven't the voice have I 
The trouble is not in your voice alone 
Your heart is not in your singing anymore 
Tell me Paula you're in love 
I'm too happy 
Happiness is better than art 
Yes of course 
You have a rendezvous with him 
The moment your lesson is over you fly to him 
Dear Maestro 
I don't know when we'll meet again 
Thank you 
Did you tell him 
He told me He didn't know who 
What did he say 
He said I should take my happiness 
And will you 
Now 
Why do you still hesitate Paula 
Nor I about you but I want to marry you 
Are you afraid 
I think I am a little 
Of me No 
No never but of happiness 
You must give me time to get used to the idea 
Waited 
We've only known each other two weeks 
No it won't be easy for me either 
I should go away Go away 
Where will you go 
I thought perhaps to the Lakes 
And when will you go 
I thought tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Is that too soon 
My dearest 
Oh my goodness Good gracious 
It's so exciting Your book 
Have a biscuit dear Thank you 
Digestive biscuits Unpleasant name isn't it 
I never travel without them 
You're not English are you 
No 
I was brought up there My aunt lived in London 
Are you on your way there now 
No I'm going to Lake Como 
All by yourself 
Yes all by myself 
But is that wise 
I don't think any harm will come to me 
The gardens are so beautiful in the spring 
Thornton Square Yes 
That's where I live Number 16 
Do you know it 
I know almost everyone who lives there now 
What number did your friends live at 
I'm afraid I don't remember 
You know we had a real live murder there 
Yes I'd heard of it 
Have another biscuit dear No thank you 
They never even found a motive 
I've tried to get in the house many a time 
Nothing's been changed 
So we are 
Is anyone meeting you 
No 
You will be careful won't you 
I will Goodbye 
You can see it from my drawing room 
You're not angry with me 
Angry 
If you hadn't come I should have sent for you 
Come and look at the morning 
Aren't you cold like this 
What were you dreaming of 
Our life together And how do you see it 
I saw all the places where we'll be together 
Lovely places like this 
Something that I want to write Yes what 
This morning Yes 
When will you start on it 
Where 
Where would you like us to settle 
I haven't thought Paris perhaps Paris 
Or Rome 
How would you feel about London 
London 
I won't laugh at you What is it 
I was in London once in the winter 
Could we settle down in London 
Not in a house in a square perhaps 
Paula why do you look like that 
9 Thornton Square 
She left it to me She 
I don't know anything about her or my father 
After it happened I never went back 
It's strange 
I haven't dreamed of it since I've known you 
I haven't been afraid since I've known you 
Afraid 
Yes 
You've cast out fear for me 
If it were true it would make me very happy 
It is true I've found peace in loving you 
You shall have your house in a square 
Good morning daffodils Good morning tulips 
Percy There it is dear 
What are you doing my good man 
Turning on the water in Number 9 ma'am 
Nine 
Why nine 
Orders ma'am 
Wouldn't care to live in there myself 
Good morning 
Good morning 
Are we late 
Not at all I've only been here a moment 
Good morning Mr Anton Good morning 
It's you 
Don't you remember me 
Yes of course I do 
Don't tell me you're coming to live in Number 9 
Yes 
We mustn't keep Mr Mufflin waiting 
Sorry I must go now Perhaps we can 
I'll call directly you're settled 
Goodbye for the present 
Goodbye I'm so glad we are to be neighbors 
So am I 
This lock needs oiling 
Good day Good day Mr Anton 
Now Paula 
This is the dining room 
Yes 
There's a little study beyond it 
And the drawing room is upstairs 
Yes 
Come Paula Don't stand there in the doorway 
Will you light the gas please 
Gregory It's a very handsome room 
Yes but to see it like this 
Those must have been wonderful days 
It's all dead in here 
The whole place seems to smell of death 
There It will all be fresh again in a moment 
That's where she kept her treasures 
I know all these by heart 
Careful dearest 
I never knew what happened to the other glove 
I wish I could have seen her 
Let me show her to you 
That's as the Empress Theodora 
That was her greatest role 
She was very beautiful very much like you 
She had been strangled 
No I can't stay here 
Don't you want to 
Later yes but not just at once 
Yes I only 
I know 
Later 
Now where should we put all these things 
There is an attic under the roof 
We'll send those upstairs with all the rest 
I'd like to have her scores to study from 
What makes you play that 
Why not 
That was her great song 
It was everybody's favorite 
Here's an old letter 
I have followed you to London 
It was written two days before she was murdered 
Where did you find that 
In this score She must have left it there 
It was written by somebody called Sergis Bauer 
Give it to me 
Gregory what is it 
I'm sorry 
I didn't mean to be so violent 
It's just that 
Why does this letter upset you so 
All these things are reminding you of her 
You must forget her 
No not her 
Only what happened to her 
Elizabeth I say Elizabeth 
Good afternoon Elizabeth It's you miss 
Good afternoon 
Good afternoon 
I said the house looks very nice now 
from the outside Yes miss 
Yes miss 
Master says seeing people isn't good for her 
She hasn't been feeling too well lately 
I'm sorry to hear that What's that miss 
Yes miss They're going out this afternoon 
First time for some while Good day miss 
Good day What lovely looking strawberries 
Good afternoon 
Your wages will be 6 a year Yes sir 
Just one more thing 
If you have any questions just come to me 
Yes sir 
That'll suit me sir 
That's why she left 
Elizabeth come in 
This is Elizabeth the cook 
Hello You'll find that she's a little deaf 
Hello Elizabeth this is our new housemaid 
Very good sir I'll see you downstairs 
She's a tartar ain't she 
What do you mean by that 
You know strict like 
I'm not gonna sleep in the same room with her 
You see the way she looked at me 
What's the matter with it 
It's a little shall we say loud 
I'm sorry Nancy Are you 
Is she sir 
Yes 
So am I 
This is our new housemaid 
How do you do 
I'm all right ma'am 
You can go now Nancy Very good sir 
She seems a nice girl 
I'm glad I hope I haven't kept you waiting 
Do you know what day today is 
Yes 
I have a present for you Paula 
Where did you find anything so beautiful 
I shall wear it always 
Always my dear 
How sweet of you to give me this 
I'm afraid the pin is not very strong 
No I'll have it mended 
You better not wear it until I have 
I am 
I didn't realize that Just little things 
I'll put it in your bag for safekeeping 
There 
Now you'll remember where it is 
That's London It's music 
Good afternoon 
Good afternoon ma'am 
It's nice to see you getting out again 
Where to ma'am 
The Tower of London 
Very good ma'am The Tower of London it is 
What's the matter with the mistress 
She don't look ill to me Is she 
I don't know Not as I can see 
But the master keeps telling her she is 
Are we going to see the torture chamber 
Certainly I think it's right over here 
Uncle Brian what's the matter 
You look as if you've seen a ghost 
Do you usually bow to people you don't know 
No I supposed I'd met him somewhere 
Are you telling me the truth 
Of course Why should I lie 
Like the other things 
What other things 
Nothing 
Only I've been noticing Paula that 
you've been forgetful lately Forgetful 
Losing things and 
Don't look so worried Paula It's nothing 
You get tired and 
Yes that's probably what it is I get tired 
I'm tired now Can't we go home 
No we still have the crown jewels to see 
What did you say 
How do you know where they are 
You haven't been here before 
The guide told us inside 
No of course not Gregory 
The Kohinoor or Mountain of Light 
It's the most famous diamond in the world 
The imperial state crown 
That's that one Yes I know 
the size of a hen's egg the Stuart sapphire 
which was among the jewels 
Jewels are wonderful things 
They have a life of their own 
Gregory can't we go home now 
Of course my dear I'll take you home 
That's the mistress's room That's the master's 
What's up there 
Never mind about up there 
The whole floor's been boarded off Why 
That's the way the master wanted it 
You were right 
No You go and work as usual 
Can you really work in that room you rented 
I never notice my surroundings when I'm working 
What's the matter 
Anything wrong 
I can't find it 
What 
I missed it when we were in the Tower 
I must turn everything out 
I know it was here I can't understand it 
I couldn't have lost it It must be here 
I'm sure it's there 
It's not 
Paula didn't I tell you 
How did you come to lose it 
It's not as serious as that It's not valuable 
You did put it in there 
Don't you even remember that 
Yes of course I do 
I tell you you're just tired that's all 
It doesn't mean anything I'm sure it doesn't 
Don't worry so Paula Don't worry 
Nancy has the master left 
Yes ma'am A little while ago 
You already told me that ma'am 
Nancy did you turn the gas up in there 
Turn it up 
No why 
I thought it went down in here as if you had 
I never touched it But this went down 
I could hear her snoring 
That's odd 
Good night Nancy Good night ma'am 
Yes that's it I beg your pardon 
How do you do How do you do 
About four or five months now Come along 
Yes A foreign couple Anton's the name 
What do you mean mysterious 
Never have visitors never go out anywhere 
At least she doesn't 
I think you're wrong 
Come along sparrows What did you say 
You seem to be wrong about her not going out 
How very surprising 
It's you ma'am I never knew you'd gone out 
Of course Why not 
Suppose the master asks where 
Tell him I just 
Now do you see what I mean 
Goes out goes back goes in 
Odd Definitely odd 
I can't get a thing out of her 
It's scandalous 
Well 
Paper Thank you sir There you are sir 
Extra Special Special edition 
Here you are governor Paper Very good sir 
Thank you sir 
Do you understand 
You had no right to go through that file 
Mr Cameron is your assistant 
What's your interest in this case anyway 
Besides 
I ever saw and I've never forgotten her 
And now 
You've seen someone who looks like her 
Living in the same house Why shouldn't she 
It's not that sir 
Perhaps even more than peculiar 
Jewels 
There's nothing here about jewels 
There were some jewels 
Some of the crown jewels of his 
That was the official theory 
Have they never shown up since 
Not as far as I know 
Well then where are they 
There was never any case against anyone 
There were the usual blind alley suspects 
You've read all their names there in that stuff 
Now run along there's a good fellow I'm busy 
Very well sir 
Good day sir 
Afternoon Mr Cameron Williams 
Did you want me sir 
Yes 
Tell me you're not a married man are you 
No sir 
Where are you on duty now 
Down in the East End sir 
How would you like a more fashionable locality 
Don't say anything to anybody for the moment 
No Paula 
Ring for the maid I can put it on myself 
We've had this subject out before 
Please pull the bell cord 
It seems so unnecessary 
What do you suppose the servants are for 
To do things To serve us I suppose 
Exactly 
Don't be cross with me 
I'm not cross with you 
There are a lot of things 
Did you ring sir 
No Your mistress rang 
I don't know it at all sir I'm sure 
Tonight is your night out isn't it 
That's right sir 
Whom are you meeting tonight 
You might light the gas too Nancy 
I see they've changed the policeman on the beat 
You do it very cleverly I grant you 
Will that be all you're wanting 
Yes except tea when it's ready 
Very good sir 
How can you talk to Nancy like that 
Despises you 
Whatever makes you think that 
Her whole manner 
Looks at you 
You're not are you Paula 
Of course I'm not 
Don't turn away Paula We must have this out 
Do you really think Nancy despises you 
Answer me Paula Do you 
No Gregory 
Come in 
What is it now 
She wanted to know if the mistress was at home 
Yes sir She has her nephew with her 
I don't think we need bore ourselves with them 
I do not want people all over this house 
Bringing her family with her 
Very good sir 
Gregory why did you do that 
I would've liked to have seen her 
I thought you were only trying to be polite 
I couldn't in front of that girl 
Show her up Nancy wasn't it 
Yes but 
I'm sorry miss That's all I know 
Please tell her how sorry we are 
Come along Auntie dear 
You wouldn't have had time to see them anyway 
You have to dress do your hair 
Why 
We're going out tonight 
We are 
You didn't tell me 
Or have I forgotten 
Don't you think this is charming 
I wish I could write tunes like Strauss 
Paula you silly child don't look like that 
Of course you haven't forgotten anything 
How wonderful 
You're the kindest man in the world 
I'm sorry 
I'm so happy

What are you looking at 
Nothing 
I thought I saw someone I knew that's all 
My watch is gone 
Paula please control yourself 
Being seen like this in public No 
Come 
I think it's the most 
Are you trying to tell me I'm insane 
Since what 
Since the day I lost your broach 
Yes that's when it all began 
No it began before that 
The first day here when I found that letter 
Sergis Bauer Yes I remember 
Yes you're right That's when it began 
I can see you still standing there and saying: 
Look at this letter and staring at nothing 
What 
You had nothing in your hand 
What 
I don't know What reason 
I didn't know then about your mother 
What about my mother 
Your mother was mad 
She died in an asylum when you were a year old 
That's not true 
I've talked to the doctor who attended her 
Would you like to see him 
No 
No Please stop 
Who 
The man who was sitting behind us 
Where 
Tonight 
What Gregory Who 
The man who bowed to you that day at the Tower 
Who is he someone from the past 
Someone you refused perhaps 
I never met him I have no idea who he is 
Who is he 
Why is he dogging my footsteps 
I don't know that he is 
You lie Why do you lie to me 
I never lie to you 
I'm sorry I should not have said that 
I know you never lie to me I believe you 
You're not lying It's worse than lying 
We shall have visitors and shortly 
A doctor 
Two 
I believe two is the required number 
Yes 
It's you Constable 
Good evening sir 
Nasty night to be out isn't it 
Very nasty sir indeed 
Where'd he go 
Yes but which 
And why 
There's no way into Number 9 from back here 
Then where did he go 
Number 5 is empty 
I don't know Williams 
Just coming ma'am 
What is it ma'am 
Did you turn on the gas 
But the gas comes in pipes ma'am 
Yes I suppose that could explain it 
Do you hear anything 
Hear anything ma'am 
Yes Up there Listen 
Those sounds Those noises up there 
No ma'am 
How could there be 
The whole floor is boarded up 
You know ma'am you just imagine things 
Well 
I got a good look at him under the lamppost 
I tell you that man had been up to something 
What 
Had he been in a fight 
He didn't look like that sir 
Have some coffee 
Thank you sir I've had my breakfast already 
Nancy tell you anything this morning 
That's right sir 
A long time you said 
Yes sir 
What do you think that means 
He goes out every evening 
Right sir 
Tonight after dinner 
There's just one thing more though 
How do you know the lady herself will see you 
I don't know 
Yes 
I think there's a way 
can hardly enter into 
Your mother was mad 
can hardly enter into the fresh gala feeling 
with which an opera or a concert 
She died in an asylum with no brain at all 
The snug comfort of the close carriage 
Did she tell you to say that 
You're Elizabeth aren't you 
How'd you know my name 
I know many things about this house 
You're fond of her aren't you 
You'd like to help her wouldn't you 
No I don't dare sir I'd lose me place 
Really I don't dare 
It's you I want to see 
Go away I'm ill I can't see anyone 
Elizabeth stop him I didn't ask him to come 
Mrs Anton my name is Brian Cameron 
You mustn't come here Go away 
I was a little boy overcome with admiration 
Now you'll trust me won't you 
You 
She gave it to you 
A little boy 
Tell me something Mrs Anton 
Are you planning on going away somewhere 
Go away 
Why no 
I have nowhere to go 
Unless my husband sends me away 
Is that why you came here 
To take me away 
Are you as frightened as all that 
I can't talk to you either I'm not 
I'm afraid I 
You're afraid you're going out of your mind 
I'm here to prove to you that you're not 
Tell me now where is your husband now 
Where has he gone 
No Why 
The gas just went down 
You saw that too Why yes 
Then it really happens I thought I imagined it 
The light goes down 
Yes And then what 
Then I think I hear things 
I watch and wait 
Yes Quite soon after 
Always quite soon after 
You say you think you hear things What things 
Sounds Noises over my room 
What's up there 
A whole floor of trunks and furniture 
Is that what you meant 
Yes 
But who 
Mrs Anton you know don't you 
You know who's up there No 
Are you sure you don't 
No 
How could he be 
There's an alley behind these houses 
Why 
All of her things 
And they said the case was dead 
Tell me has he any weapons in the house 
He has a revolver Why shouldn't he 
Do you know where he keeps it 
I think he has it in his desk in there 
You can't open his desk 
He'll know He'll think that I 
What should I say to him 
You won't have to say anything 
Perhaps it's a good thing I came tonight 
I was right 
There was a letter 
And it was from Sergis Bauer What was that 
What was that name you said 
Sergis Bauer 
Bauer It's been here the whole time 
Let me see that 
I followed you to London 
Look 
So is this 
Why 
Search 
What is there to search for 
Her jewels 
I have her jewels 
Someone he never saw 
A little girl 
Me 
So he was here that night but he never 
He never knew her 
You're wrong You're making a mistake 
I know him He's my husband 
I've lived in the same house with him 
You're talking about the man I'm married to 
Nothing real from the beginning 
No But you must believe me 
Nothing less than your whole life 
Don't you see the way everything fits in 
The gas 
How long has it been up 
You can count on me sir 
He won't come back anymore Elizabeth 
What are you doing 
I was lying down 
Fully dressed 
Did you hear what I said 
Yes 
Then why don't you answer 
I don't know You don't know 
Do you know anything about anything you do 
Sit down in this chair 
But you're not asleep No you can't deceive me 
Now be careful how you answer 
Why did you open my desk 
I didn't open your desk 
Nancy 
Nancy's out 
Who then 
Elizabeth 
No it wasn't Elizabeth 
No Stay there Paula 
Why did you open my desk

What are you talking about 
Who is he 
A man 
A man who came to see me 
When 
While you were out 
Who let him in 
Yes sir 
What man sir 
No one was here sir while you were out 
But Elizabeth

I couldn't have dreamed it 
No I couldn't have dreamed it 
Did I dream 
Did I really dream 
Are you telling me that I've dreamed 
Everything 
All that happened 
All that did not happen 
Then it's true 
My mind is going Haven't I told you 
It was a dream Like all the rest 
It was a dream Take me away 
You 
Who the devil are you 
You made it very easy 
Will you tell me what you're doing here 
You'd better explain your business sir 
I could hardly be said to have any business 
Paula go to your room please 
So you found them after all 
I was right about you 
This is where Alice Alquist hid them 
For the last time what do you want 
The jewels and justice 
What is it ma'am 
I thought I heard a shot 
Help Mr Williams come quick 
Up there 
Anybody at home 
Well Mrs Anton you believe me now 
Perhaps you'd like to see these things 
I assure you I'm quite helpless Please 
I'll be waiting on the stairs 
Go and see if he's listening 
They were lies Why should he lie to me 
Do you 
Do you really Gregory 
Or shall I call you Sergis 
So he told you that too What of it 
Sergis Bauer's mine 
They don't hang a man for that do they 
No they don't hang a man for that 
You remember our first days 
You remember Italy 
Come closer Paula 
Closer 
Look into my eyes 
Get it and cut me free 
Be quick Paula Get me the knife Cut me free 
Yes I'll get it I'll get it for you 
Hurry Paula 
There's no knife here Yes I put it there 
Have you gone mad my husband 
Or is it I who am mad 
Yes of course That's it 
I am mad 
I'm always losing things and hiding things 
That was a knife wasn't it And I have lost it 
Paula I must look for it mustn't I 
Where could it be now 
Perhaps it's behind this picture 
Yes it must be here No 
Where shall I look now 
My broach The broach I lost at the Tower 
I found it at last You see 
But it doesn't help you does it 
And I'm trying to help you to escape aren't I 
How can a madwoman help you escape 
But you're not mad 
Yes I am mad as my mother was 
No Paula That wasn't true Help me 
If I were not mad I could have helped you 
But because I am mad I hate you 
Take this man away 
You ready 
Quite ready 
I don't ask you to understand me 
A fire in my brain that separated us 
Those jewels which I wanted all my life 
I don't know why 
The cab is coming Mr Cameron 
Goodbye Paula 
Goodbye Gregory 
This night will be a long night 
But it will end It's starting to clear 
You'll find that too 
You're very kind 
Well 
I shall never forget the weekend Laura died 
It was the hottest Sunday in my recollection 
For with Laura's horrible death I was alone 
I had him wait 
I could watch him through the half open door 
Careful there That stuff is priceless 
Come in here please 
Mr Lydecker 
Ah you recognize me How splendid 
Sit down please 
It's lavish but I call it home 
Why did you write it down 
Afraid you'd forget it 
I am the most widely misquoted man in America 
When my friends do it I resent it 
Hand me that washcloth please Mr 
Mr 
McPherson 
McPherson McPherson 
Well well Hand me my robe please 
You have a pretty good memory Mr Lydecker 
Have you any more questions 
Yeah just one 
Did I 
Yeah 
But he was really killed with a sash weight 
How ordinary My version was obviously superior 
I never bother with details you know 
I do Well so long 
Mind if I go with you 
What for 
Murder is my favorite crime 
I'd like to study their reactions 
You're on the list yourself you know Good 
Do you really suspect me 
Yes 
How singularly innocent I look this morning 
Have you ever seen such candid eyes 
No thanks 
Were you in love with Laura Hunt Mr Lydecker 
Was she in love with you 
I was in complete accord with her on that point 
Did you agree with her there too 
Have any luck 
Let me put it this way 
Shall we go 
Waldo Good morning Ann 
Thanks 
Certainly I'll do anything I can to help 
You were fond of your niece Mrs Treadwell 
Why I adored her Cigarette 
Why 
Shouldn't I approve 
What do you mean 
Is he an acquaintance 
Friend 
Are you in love with him 
This is beginning to assume fabulous aspects 
Oh shut up Waldo 
What are you driving at 
Why no I'm 
I'm very fond of Mr Carpenter of course 
Oh don't be so annoying Waldo 
Did you give Mr Carpenter money 
What do you mean 
One on May 15 for $250 One on May 22 for $400 
Oh that I 
Shelby's a very obliging fellow 
Sometimes 1 500 
Sometimes 1 700 at a clip 
Yes I needed that money 
When you withdrew 1 700 he deposited 1 550 
Maybe they were shooting crap 
Oh must I be insulted like this 
Because he didn't ask me 
We were just talking about you Carpenter 
Oh how do you do Lieutenant 
I didn't know you were here Mr Carpenter 
As a matter of fact I was just lying down here 
You know how it is Lieutenant 
I've hardly slept a wink since it happened 
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence McPherson 
No he doesn't know and neither do I 
Would you like a bite of lunch Lieutenant 
That's very thoughtful the perfect host 
But Lieutenant I 
Oh Brahms's First and Beethoven's Ninth 
No but I think there's one up in her apartment 
All right Come along 
I'll be seeing you Mrs Treadwell 
Extra 
Extra 
Girl victim in brutal slaying 
Extra 
Girl victim in brutal slaying 
Read all about it 
Girl victim in brutal slaying 
Girl victim in brutal slaying 
Read all about it 
All right Break it up Break it up 
The doorbell rang What 
As she opened the door the shot was fired 
And how do you deduce that 
She fell backward The body was there 
I thought you hadn't been up here before 
I saw the police photos 
I guess I better try and find that key 
Will you stop calling her a dame 
Look around 
Is this the home of a dame 
Look at her 
Not bad 
Have you ever been in love 
Would you mind turning that off 
Why 
Don't you like it 
You know a lot about music 
Yeah 
I wouldn't worry about it Mr Carpenter 
Thank you 
You found that key yet 
Yes here it is 
I knew there must be one around somewhere 
Then it's made a recent reappearance 
You put it there didn't you 
Yes Why 
Everything about Laura concerns me 
Very well I'll stop implying 
I'll make a direct statement 
All right you asked for it 
I wouldn't 
Okay let's go 
This was our table 
Laura's and mine 
We spent many quiet evenings here together 
Just we two happy making plans for her future 
Good luck 
Pardon me Excuse me 
Excuse me 
Mr Lydecker how do you do 
You know the big advertising firm 
Yes I know 
Now this is 
Or possibly both 
Possibly but here's what I wanted to show you 
I don't use a pen 
I write with a goose quill dipped in venom 
Wouldn't you at least consider endorsing it 
I hate pens 
Oh no You mustn't do that 
Indeed 
Just think what it would mean 
What 
My lunch 
Do you really believe that 
Implicitly 
I never heard of anything so selfish 
That's what makes your column so good 
Sentiment comes easily at 50 cents a word 
You begin to bore me You're a poor man 
I'm very sorry for you 
I had to speak to her again I had to see her 
Thank you 
Announce me 
Johnny please tell the gentleman I'm busy 
Miss Hunt I have something to say to you 
You've already said it Mr Lydecker 
Ordinarily I am not without a heart 
Really 
Shall I produce X ray pictures to prove it 
I wish to apologize 
Your apology is accepted 
Good bye Mr Lydecker 
If you come a little bit closer my boy 
I can just crack your skull with my stick 
I'd like to endorse that pen 
Mr Lydecker 
Thank you 
You're a very strange man What 
It's very kind of you you know 
But if you choose to think me kind 
I'll call for you at 6:00 
All right 
All right 
Her career began with my endorsement of the pen 
She had an eager mind always 
Laura had innate breeding 
But she deferred to my judgment and taste 
I selected a more attractive hairdress for her 
Through me she met everyone 
The famous and the infamous 
She had warmth vitality 
She had authentic magnetism 
Wherever we went she stood out 
Men admired her Women envied her 
I read my articles to her 
These were the best nights 
It didn't matter really 
I couldn't understand it 
I walked for a long time 
But I waited I wanted to see who he was 
I never liked the man 
How do you do 
Hello Shelby Excuse me honey 
You're Laura Hunt 
Yes 
Hello I'm Shelby Carpenter 
Want to dance 
I'm not alone

Excuse me please 
Yes 
Betsy Ross taught it to me

I see you've met Shelby Hello Ann 
His family's from Kentucky

I'm afraid it's rouge 
I'm afraid it's liquor Louise Oh 
May I have a glass of milk for Mr Lydecker 
Of course Miss Hunt 
I forgot to tell you I also read palms 
What more can you want of a man 
What do you mean 
We're old friends

And what does it feel like Mr Carpenter 
What does what feel like Miss Hunt 
Living on the income from an estate

Why maintain the fiction 
Why not work 
He thought I was joking Weren't you

And that reminds me 
These aren't only insinuations my dear 
There you are Read them 
What of it 
I know his faults A man can change can't he 
All right I'm helping Shelby 
His past is his own affair 
I only care about the present 
Her name is Diane Redfern 
I'm sorry I should have told you before 
Shelby and I are going to be married next week 
Rather valuable isn't it 
Where did you get it 
Carpenter proud 
Before this goes any further why I'll just 
He isn't home 
He's dining at Ann Treadwell's 
He can't be He asked me to dinner 
He treats her rather badly these days 
I'm afraid she'll say he isn't there 
Waldo why are you doing this 
For you Laura 
Shall we pay them a visit 
He won't be there Waldo I know he won't 
All right We'll see 
Good evening Good evening 
Good evening 
There you are my dear 
In a moment of supreme disaster he's trite 
You've been reading too many melodramas Waldo 
Well have you two had dinner 
Would you like a glass of wine 
Why don't you sit down 
What came of it I hoped to hear that night 
I can't have dinner with you tonight 
Oh no no 
I'm not sick I'm just dreadfully nervous 
I'm going to the country for a few days 
Yes I'm afraid it's about Shelby 
Oh no Please There's nothing you can do 
I've got to think this thing out for myself 
It was the last time I ever heard her voice 
But 
Where does this Diane Redfern live 
Brooklyn somewhere She's in the phone book 
Come on It's late Let's get going 
Waiter Yes sir 
All right Thank you Mr Lydecker 
Good night 
It was my fault 
I should have stopped it somehow 
Well it's too late now 
Thanks for the wine 
Hello Mosconi's 
This is Lieutenant McPherson Homicide Bureau 
Yeah 
Yeah 
I see 
Well that's all I wanted to know Thanks 
She's here McPherson the maid 
Okay 
Sit down Bessie 
Her letters 
And her private diary 
You've been reading them pawing over them 
It's a shame 
Don't you go ordering me around 
What do you want to know 
What we all want to know who killed Laura Hunt 
How would I know 
You don't think I done it 
Ask anyone anyone who ever come to this house 
I would have worked for her 
But you cops wouldn't know about that 
I put it there 
No When did you put it in the cabinet 
Saturday Before the police came 
Was it there Friday night before you left 
No 
Are you sure of that 
Yes Who 
And that ain't all I done 
I don't care 
Go ahead but it won't do you any good 
Get me some ice and a setup will you 
All right 
Good morning Lieutenant McPherson sent for us 
Good morning Lieutenant Hello McPherson 
Care to join me 
I'll get it Never mind 
Bessie would you bring a couple more glasses 
Yes sir 
Hi Bessie What are you doing here 
This do 
I presume it'll have to 
How about you Carpenter 
It's cheap but it's potent 
Yes sir 
I remember when Laura bought these glasses 
She loved them She loved all her things so 
What are you going to do 
Sell them 
I don't know I suppose so Thank you 
You mean Lancaster Corey the art dealer 
Yes He was a friend of Laura's 
Not quite everything Ann 
Two or three things in here belong to me 
I only lent them to Laura you know 
Oh really Waldo 
Yes really 
And the clock and the screen too 
Nothing is leaving here except you Lydecker 
Is that your quaint way of indicating dismissal 
Yeah Well don't you want to see me 
Don't you want to ask me some questions 
I'll be seeing you 
Well I bid you good day 
We're doing all right 
Thanks Take your time 
Fred 
Yes 
What's the matter 
Did you go to sleep 
This is McPherson Any calls come through 
Well keep listening 
No Nothing new 
I happened to see the lights on 
Have you sublet this apartment 
You're here often enough to pay rent 
Any objections 
Yes 
Why 
Yours are the best in the bunch Thanks 
But I didn't write them to you 
Haven't you any sense of privacy 
Murder victims have no claim to privacy 
That's none of your business 
I see you have Why don't you go home 
I'm busy 
Perhaps we can come to terms now 
You want the portrait Perfectly understandable 
Also perfectly understandable Now if you 
Get going 
What are you doing here 
You're alive 
You are Laura Hunt aren't you 
Aren't you 
Mark McPherson 
What's this all about 
Don't you know 
Don't you know what's happened 
No 
Haven't you seen the papers 
Where have you been 
Up in the country I I don't get a newspaper 
Haven't you got a radio 
It was broken 
What 
Somebody was murdered in this room 
Do you have any idea who it was 
No 
Who had a key to your apartment 
Nobody 
Are you sure 
When did it happen 
Friday night 
What are you going to do now 
Yeah 
I found this in my closet 
It's Diane Redfern's 
Just about my size 
Beautiful wasn't she 
Do you suppose 
Sit down please 
This is Monday night You left on Friday 
Rather a long weekend isn't it 
Yes 
What train did you take 
The 7:26 
See anybody you knew on the train 
No 
Then what 
Then I got off the train at Norwalk 
Saw nobody you knew at the station either 
No 
Then I drove to my house 
You were there three days What did you do 
Work in my garden 
You didn't go out in all that time 
No I had everything I needed in the house 
Nobody came to see you 
Nobody 
I went there to be alone 
Oh yes Saturday I took a long walk 
I walked for hours in the woods 
Thursday if I'm not mistaken 
Yes 
I was tired I'd been working hard 
I know nothing of the sort He hasn't 
How else did the girl get into the apartment 
You know all that don't you 
When did she tell you 
At lunch last Friday 
How could I 
My own safety 
Do you suspect me 
I see you have been trying to get at the truth 
Strictly routine 
I'm sorry Really 
But 
But I've got to let my friends know I'm alive 
Am I under arrest 
No 
All right I promise 
There's one more thing 
What did you decide 
I want the truth 
I decided not to marry him 
I'll see you in the morning Good night 
Good night 
Really 
Does McPherson know that 
Uh huh Well okay Good bye 
Yeah 
Say you're not taking it too hard 
Wait a minute 
Hello 
This is Laura I've 
Was that Yeah 
Dames are always pulling a switch on you 
Stand by 
You follow her I'm gonna tail him 
When 
Oh a while back I don't know exactly 
You know about guns don't you 
Yes How come you didn't clean it afterward 
I don't know I forgot I suppose 
Your initials 
Yes I gave it to Laura for protection 
She didn't want it but I insisted 
This house is rather isolated as you see 
Did you teach her how to use it 
No 
Does she know how 
I don't know It didn't occur to me to ask 
You haven't borrowed it lately 
You didn't just bring it back tonight 
You uh realize the spot you're in Carpenter 
You knew all along it was she who was murdered 
You're being fantastic McPherson 
I took it there over a week ago 
I can't help what Bessie said 
Where's the key to her apartment 
I haven't got it 
I never had one 
Well I You had a key and I know it 
Now come on Carpenter Spill it I 
So we went to Laura's Yeah 
We talked there for about three hours 
and then the doorbell rang and Go on 
I've learned to be surprised at nothing 
I asked Diane to answer the door 
Why didn't you go yourself 
Why open the door at all 
They must have seen the light 
What about the girl 
Diane what about her reputation 
It was an awful explosion 
By the time I reached her the door was closed 
I I don't think I fully grasped the situation 
I think I called her name but I'm not sure I 
My first instinct was to call the police 
Why didn't you 
I don't know 
Don't you understand that 
Did you think Laura had done it 
Did you 
I don't remember what I thought 
Do you think so now 
No 
But you didn't 
No 
I was incapable of thinking at all 
What did she want 
Why don't you tell the truth 
She sent you here to get rid of this gun 
It works fine doesn't it 
Yes Did you think it wouldn't 
I hoped it wouldn't All right Let's go 
Well am I under arrest 
Good morning Good morning 
What's that 
Breakfast 
Suppose you set the table while I get breakfast 
Do you always sound like this in the morning 
Don't tell me you can cook 
Shh 
Don't move 
It's all right Bessie It's all right Bessie 
She's alive 
It's all been a mistake Bessie 
I'm not a ghost Really 
I found you and you were dead 
It was Miss Redfern's body you found 
But I I saw it with my own eyes 
I I don't understand it 
Have you ever heard a ghost ask for eggs 
No miss 
You'll be all right Bessie 
Somebody should have warned her Poor Bessie 
Did you tell him 
No 
Why not 
It's brutal 
I'm not doing it for fun 
You forced me to give you my word 
I don't do of my own free will 
Redfern was in love with Carpenter 
You admitted that last night 
May I have a match please 
Oh I'm sorry 
I also told you that he wasn't in love with her 
Just sit still 
Hello Lieutenant 
Morning my darling Hello dear 
Ah Thank you 
Oh It's on again 
So he made you change your mind 
I have just come from my lawyer 
Yeah 
Besides none of it was true 
Maybe 
Waldo 
Waldo 
Right hand pocket 
You want a doctor 
Right hand pocket 
We'd better take him into the bedroom 
What Don't try and say anything dear 
Just be quiet 
I think this is carrying things too far 
Yeah 
How does he feel now 
It was a terrible shock Poor darling 
Don't tell me you're in love with him too 
Shut up Why do you cover up for a guy like him 
He's beginning to crack up 
I've got enough on you to arrest you right now 
Quick McPherson the handcuffs 
It's an old family custom 
Too bad Diane Redfern can't be resurrected 
Do your duty McPherson 
For the moment 
People are coming to celebrate your return 
Ann and Bullitt and Corey Everybody 
Who asked them to come 
I did when I was in there 
I phoned my man and he's calling everyone 
Why did you do that Waldo 
A sense of the fitness of things my dear 
You're working yourself to death darling 
Oh after all it isn't your homecoming 
Aren't you being a little bit nasty Ann 
I feel nasty when I don't see you 
So do I Well here you go 
Shelby why don't you come to your senses 
Thanks Ann but you see Laura needs me Sorry 
Laura Thanks 
I don't mind Talk to her as much as you like 
Trying to make you like him to make you talk 
Shelby tell me why did you go to 
Excuse me 
Why did you go to the cottage last night 
But don't you know 
What shotgun 
The one I gave you 
You don't have to lie to me darling 
I'll stand by you 
What's the matter Laura 
Oh I guess I'm just nervous That's all 
So am I 
McPherson suspects Shelby 
He seems to suspect me too 
And so do some of my friends 
You 
Don't be absurd 
Oh I don't think he did it 
But he's capable of it 
But Ann I only met him last night 
That's more than long enough sometimes 
Shelby's better for me Why 
Because I can afford him and I understand him 
He's no good but he's what I want 
I'm not a nice person Laura Neither is he 
He knows I know he's just what he is 
He also knows that I don't care 
That's why I know he's capable of murder 
He's like me 
No dear I didn't but I thought of it 
Hello 
Yes Yes 
Oh it's for you Lieutenant 
Thank you Bessie 
Yeah I know Don't worry 
I told you I'd bring in the killer today 
No I can't tell you now I'm not alone 
You'll see when I come in 
Right See you later 
All right Let's go 
You mean Yeah 
Oh no 
No 
No no 
Not Miss Hunt 
Please 
Thank you Bessie 
Thank you 
Yes miss Laura 
Don't worry darling Let them accuse you 
We'll fight them 
I'll expose your cheap methods you used on her 
Can we go now I warned you 
Wait a minute 
Shelby 
Oh did he hurt you darling 
Darling 
Ann 
Come in 
Sit down 
That'll be all Gallagher Yes sir 
All right Let's have it Look at me 
You've been holding out and I want to know why 
It'll be easier for you if you tell the truth 
What difference does it make what I say 
You've made up your mind I'm guilty 
Are you 
Don't tell me you have any doubts 
Since you Oh I can't 
Then why 
Because it was broken Not when I tried it 
How did he get in 
Well I I changed my mind 
What are you trying to hide 
Don't you realize you're involved in a murder 
This is no time for secrets 
Did he persuade you to make up 
Or did you agree to pretend you had 
Was that it 
Well we 
That is both of us thought 
Did you believe he was guilty 
No I'm sure he isn't 
Are you in love with him 
I don't see how I ever could have been 
Come on You're going home 
You and a few others I didn't even book you 
You mean this was some sort of a game 
Wasn't there an easier way to make sure 
Then it was worth it Mark 
I'll call a cab for you 
Good night I'll see you tomorrow 
Good night Mark 
I'm going over to Lydecker's apartment 
It still doesn't make sense to me Laura 
I don't think so 
He's been dealing with criminals too long 
Do you know what he calls women Dames 
His very words That doesn't mean anything 
He isn't like that 
Laura you have one tragic weakness 
No man is ever going to hurt me again 
No one not even you 
I 
Hurt you 
Laura look at me 
It makes him bitter Laura 
He wants to hurt someone as he's been hurt 
We'll be back together again 
I don't like to remind her 
I hope 
It could be but it isn't 
You're not yourself darling Yes I am 
Very well 
My congratulations McPherson 
Listen to my broadcast in 15 minutes 
I'm discussing great lovers of history 
All I need is the gun 
What are you doing 
Do you know the combination to this thing 
Have you ever seen this before 
No 
Waldo gave you that clock didn't he 
Yes 
She opened the door The room was dark 
She fell here 
I knew it 
I couldn't make myself believe that 
Waldo was a murderer 
I killed her What are you talking about 
That's nonsense Forget it 
No Mark I can't 
But I couldn't help myself I owed him too much 
I'll have the clock picked up tomorrow 
What are you going to do 
Arrest Waldo 
Mark Can't be helped 
That's to make sure you're not disturbed 
If the doorbell rings don't answer it 
Love is stronger than life 
It reaches beyond the dark shadow of death 
Brief Life ' 
love and desire and hate 
I was going to when he came out 
They are not long the days of wine and roses 
That's the way it is isn't it Laura 
Waldo 
Waldo you've taken one life Isn't that enough 
The best part of myself that's what you are 
Laura 
It's Mark 
Open the door 
There he is now 
Laura

He helped me into the lifeboat with my things 
I thought this boat was abandoned 
What part of the ship are you from darling 
Engine room 
I was off duty in the washroom Thanks 
Caught with my 
Most of the crew were trapped like rats 
When they got to topside it was a shambles 
Quite a night 
Ha 
Now I can perfect my backhand 
Get that It might come in handy 
Let's have the cap too 
What are we worryin' about this junk for 
She won't surface

It's all in here my pet 
You're Constance Porter 
I heard you were aboard 
So you took pictures 
And what pictures Priceless

Then a shell hit the lifeboat 
They all jumped overboard 
Look 
That's a perfect touch 
What did you do that for 
Help 
Gangway 
You stupid clumsy son of a — 
Why don't you look where you're going 
Absolutely irreplaceable stuff 
Priceless The best film I ever took 
Goes to the bottom of the sea 
That's better than going there yourself 
When will I ever get stuff like that again 
Of all the stupid clumsy — 
Hardly 
Where'd this come from 
It was floating by 
Miss MacKenzie 
Stanley 
She's out there 
She's alive 
Come on Kovac 
Come on 
There's somebody out there 
To your right Kovac

Holy smokes Look at this mess 
Maybe we'd better get the raft back 
Do you think we'll stay afloat 
Just the bare necessities Uh look at that 
Six full boxes and I had to grab this one 
Don't cry my pet 
It'll last until we're picked up 
I hope 
First shell must've done for the skipper 
And most of the gun crew 
What happened to the woman with the baby 
See if you can find a first aid kit 
I thought everybody was killed 
I never expected to see you alive 
You know I'm practically immortal Ritt 
Now how do you get this thing off 
Here's the first aid kit 
It's been pretty well smashed up 
Oh

Let me have that blanket please 
Bandages please

Lie down please 
What for 
You'll be more comfortable

Here's 20 bucks Mr Jones didn't get 
Well it's yours

We're among friends ain't we 
I don't think it's advisable 
Look 
Just one slug 
It'll pick me up 
Make up your minds darlings 
Help 
Help 
It's Charcoal 
It's the steward 
There's a woman 
Easy there 
Give me the baby 
Are you all right Joe 
I got my feet wet a little bit 
She was fightin' me all the time in the water 
She tried to drown the baby and herself with it 
Huh it's all right sister You're safe 
The baby's safe 
It's all right 
The danger's over 
You're safe now 
Nothing to worry about 
Best let her have it 
We'll wait till she's asleep 
Here 
Hey 
That's right 
Her name's Higley 
She was bombed out in Bristol 
Here darling 
You'd better put this on 
Hey look 
Another customer 
Where'd he come from 
Is he a crew member 
I never saw him before 
Not off our boat 
Danke schön 
Ask him why they shelled our lifeboats 
Captain's orders 
If you ask me he's the captain himself 
Ask him if he's the captain 
Well crew member or skipper he's German 
That don't make him a nightingale 
Get him outta here 
Don't be silly darling 
Throw him off 
Have you gone out of your mind 
Throw the Nazi buzzard overboard 
That's out of the question 
It's against the law 
Whose law 
We're on our own 
We can make our own law 
Now just a minute 
He was acting under orders 
Our freighter was an enemy ship 
After all we're at war 
Is that woman at war 
Is her baby at war 
And listen how come you know the lingo so well 
I was going someplace 
I was going into a lifeboat 
What is this 
Are you insinuating 
What do you mean my friend 
Now children let's keep our shirts on 
I haven't got a shirt or a mink coat either 
Oh I get it 
A fellow traveller 
I thought the Comintern was dissolved 
The boat's too small for me and this German 
That's the American way 
That's the uh 
That's the Christian way 
Okay 
Now me I'm American too 
I was born one in Chicago 
But my people are from Czechoslovakia 
Ever hear of that place 
Me too 
Just for the record I'm an American myself 
I'm in a kind of a spot 
My name is Schmidt but I changed it to Smith 
I got a lot of relatives in Germany 
For all I know this guy may be one of them 
I say throw him to the sharks 
The right 
What do you mean the right 
Well he's a prisoner of war 
Got to be treated as such 
Till such time we represent the authorities 
That's clear isn't it 
You see what I mean miss 
I don't understand any of it 
I just don't understand it 
Then what are you doing in a uniform 
I'm doing the only thing I can 
So do I 
Material for your book 
Incidentally 
George 
What do you say Joe 
Do I get to vote too 
Why Why certainly 
Guess I'd rather stay out of this 
How about you sister 
My baby's dead 
Does anyone know the service for burial at sea 
Well I uh I suppose any prayer would do 
Let me see now 
The Lord is my shepherd Uh I shall not want 
He uh 
He leadeth me beside the still waters 
He restoreth my soul 
I will fear no evil 
For thou art with me 
Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me 
Amen 
Well at any rate things are getting shipshape 
Uh Kovac don't forget to wake me for my watch 
We'd better send up another flare soon 
How do you feel darling 
Better thank you 
Much better 
Have I been asleep long 
Not very 
What's this 
It's a beautiful coat 
Is it real mink I hope so 
It's lovely 
I've always admired mink 
So warm and comfortable 
Thank you so much for letting me wear it 
Where's Johnny 
Where's my baby 
What have you done with him 
What did you do with my baby 
Your baby's dead 
Don't you remember 
You killed him didn't you 
Poor little thing 
The sea so big and terrible 
Johnny it's Mum 
Where are you 
Where are you Johnny 
Johnny Let me go 
Let me go to him 
Get a rope somebody 
We've got to tie her down 
Here you are 
Let me go to him 
Let me go 
Good morning sir Hmm Oh 
Good morning Sparks Asleep on watch 
It's a fine thing 
I oughta be court martialed 
I wonder how much we've drifted 
Not very far with that sea anchor out 
Oh the sea anchor of course 
They really keep the boat from drifting 
You've been torpedoed before 
That's right twice 
How long before you were picked up 
Last time it was 43 days 
Forty three That must have been awful 
Yeah 
We did get a bit sunburned 
Everything intact 
Well haven't we plenty too 
A good deal of our food's been ruined 
What worries me is the compass 
Knocked to pieces 
That's a bit awkward 
And of course there's Jerry 
Ah good morning Mrs Porter 
What's good about it 
How soon do we get picked up 
Good morning Connie 
We were discussing that 
It seems there's no way of telling 
Did you sleep well 
Not a wink 
Not only that I froze 
Only had my fur coat to keep me warm 
Where's Miss Higley 
I'm sorry folks 
I'm terribly sorry 
It was pitch black when I relieved you Kovac 
I couldn't see a thing 
Eight biscuits 
Minus eight biscuits 
Oh thanks 
Kovac how's the sail coming along 
Coming along Light sir 
Uh no thanks 
A going concern 
As we might have to wait as long as uh 
as 43 days 
Uh Sparks 
Yes Mr Rittenhouse 
Call me Ritt 
We're all in the same boat 
Yes sir 
Sparks you are uh in charge of navigation 
Aye aye sir 
Uh George 
Call me Joe 
Is your name Joe 
Yes sir 
Very well 
Joe it is 
You are head of the commissary 
Including the Scandinavian 
Yes 
Miss MacKenzie 
You are in charge of sick bay 
Don't look now but I think we have a skipper 
Who elected Mr Rittenhouse 
Mr Rittenhouse 
Ritt to you 
You think he's capable 
Sure Till the sail goes up 
We never should've let him stay on board 
What are you afraid of 
He's one against seven 
It was eight yesterday 
Or have you forgotten 
Say maybe we can beat that record 
Heaven forbid 
We might even get in the newsreels 
Rosie'd get a bang outta that 
We danced 80 consecutive hours 
Consecutive 
How'd you feel after 80 hours of dancing 
She grabbed a cab went right over to Roseland 
Does she work there 
She lives there 
How does the leg feel now 
It don't feel at all 
I wish I could walk around 
I sure hope that thing don't leave me gimpy 
Al'd love that 
Who's Al 
Al Magaroulian He's an Armenian rug cutter 
A little 
See if you can fix this clasp 
Mrs Porter I've read a lot of your stuff 
You wanna know what's the matter with it 
No do tell me 
You've been all over the world 
You've met all kinds of people 
Come on Sparks 
Joe man the tiller till we're squared away 
Well folks we're under way 
Where to 
Huh 
Where are we going 
First operator said we were headed for Bermuda 
Yes sir Uh what about the course 
Does anybody here know the course to Bermuda 
I was at the wheel when we got punctured 
The course was 115 east southeast 
Fine then east southeast it is 
Yes sir 
But uh where is east southeast 
Without a compass 
What's the matter with the sun 
I think it's out that way 
You think 
Doesn't anybody know 
He says east southeast is that direction 
How's he know 
Well he ought to know 
At least he'd have good food and a bed 
I wouldn't trust anything he says 
Who says so 
We'll follow the German's course 
Who elected you skipper 
What do you know about a ship 
He just happens to own a shipyard that's all 
Has he ever been in it 
He has thousands of employees 
Of course he knows how to handle men 
Not in a lifeboat 
Who me 
I'm a disabled seaman 
Anyhow I never did have no executive ability 
I think maybe Sparks there 
No not me 
With what 
An oil can 
He wasn't the captain 
Wasn't he 
Herr Kapitän 
Well I'm a monkey's uncle 
There 
You have a man who's familiar with these waters 
You're crazy 
Now wait a minute 
There are two sides to everything 
Let's look at this calmly and reasonably 
Because I'm taking charge 
Since when 
As of now I'm skipper 
I'll buy it 
Suits me 
What about you miss I'm for it 
Yes sir 
Well if the rest agree 
All right Commissar what's the course 
Well we 
Which way'd you say Sparks 
Out there 
Nein nein 
He insists the course to Bermuda is that way 
We'll head this way 
Take the tiller Sparks 
Aye aye sir 
Careful 
Including the Scandinavian 
How do you feel now Connie 
Awful 
Oh quit grousing Why shouldn't I grouse 
First my beautiful stocking then my camera 
I get positively ill when I think about it 
Take China for example 
Me too 
I'd have been in Spain by this time 
Spain 
Were you going for the state department 
State department 
Certainly not 
What for 
What for 
Why my dear fellow 
Pipe down Ritt 
The Gay Pay oo 
What are you doing with my memo pad 
I borrowed it from you to make a deck of cards 
Never heard such impertinence opening my bag 
It was open 
How about a little draw poker 
Eh suits me fine 
Deal you in 
With a deck you've made darling 
What are you gonna play for 
Dollar limit 
That'll do for a starter 
Cut for deal 
All right 
You deal 
What are those letters on your diaphragm 
Love letters 
Oh you believe in advertising 
Open 
Stay 
Three cards 
Open 
Nines 
Queens 
See how many are there 
One two three four five 
Remind me to show you the rest of them sometime 
Your deal my boy 
And see you deal them off the top 
I was just joking 
I never thought I'd go into it 
I used to faint at the sight of blood 
What made you join the merchant marine 
I don't know 
Never thought about it 
I suppose it was 'cause I lived in Greenwich 
Maybe it was the river there and the ships 
I'm glad the freighter was torpedoed 
Oh wait Let me 
Holy mackerel 
Ain't it a lulu 
What about it Miss 
I don't know 
Get away from here 
What did he say 
Gus I'm afraid your leg's very bad 
Gangrene 
Ja Gangrene 
It'll have to be amputated at once 
I've never even assisted in an amputation 
What the devil does he know about it 
He says he was a surgeon in civilian life 
He's done many operations 
If he did they were probably illegal 
I don't know and I don't care 
The leg has to come off 
No dice 
I don't want no operation 
Darling you want to live don't you 
Not with one leg 
Don't be a sap Gus 
You don't understand 
Sure I do 
Rosie 
What's Rosie got to do with it 
Everything 
If I lose my leg I lose Rosie 
Of course I don't know Rosie 
She loves to dance 
It's her hobby 
It's her whole life 
Put yourself in her place 
Do you like to dance 
Mad about it 
If my leg goes Rosie goes 
If she's that kind of a — 
Don't you call Rosie that kind of a — 
I oughta know 
I introduced you to her didn't I 
I knew her before Al Magaroulian did 
Al Magaroulian — 
Rosie's as good as anybody 
And a darn sight better 
If she was the right kind of a woman 
Kovac you take that back 
Listen to me 
I don't know Rosie but I know women 
Some of my best friends are women 
And one of 'em's that kind of a — 
What kind of a 
That's Rosie all over With a heart of gold 
And she gives it away 
Rosie'd give the shirt off her back to anybody 
She's got a heart as big as her head 
And you wanna break it 
Who me 
Well you'd rather die than trust her 
Who says I don't trust her 
It's Al Magaroulian I don't trust 
He knew her before I did 
Maybe there wasn't 
I shoulda took care of that insurance 
Not knowing whether you're dead or alive 
God forgive me 
Poor kid she'd be broken hearted when she — 
Well let's go 
What are we all waitin' for 
He'll need a pail of water Joe 
Is there any sort of anaesthetic 
Nothing 
Nein 
You have some brandy haven't you 
He says brandy's better than nothing 
Did I hear brandy 
Let me get it for you 
Oh thanks Joe 
Can you open it for me 
That's right 
Here darling 
Hi yo Silver 
He'll need a tourniquet a belt or something 
I'll lose my pants if I take mine off 
How about your belt Sparks 
Here it is 
Get it Joe 
Um oh Joe 
Aah 
Am I gonna feel good pretty soon 
Kovac why'd you want to say that about Rosie 
Say what 
What you said 
I'm sorry Gus 
Take it back 
Okay I take it back 
What can we use for forceps 
You have tweezers 
I've got tweezers 
Yes Joe you'll find them in my bag 
The little box on the top 
Right 
Ask him how much of that stuff he can drink 
Go ahead Gus 
The works 
Down the hatch 
I'll never forget you 
Joe clear away some of that stuff 
We'll lay him out here 
Two legged skunk 
I hate his guts 
You're okay pal 
Hi Lu 
Hiya Gus 
Well anyway it's an experience 
I oughta have my head examined 
I didn't have to go to sea 
I coulda joined the army or even the navy 
Mr Rittenhouse 
Yes son 
Call me Gus 
Hiya babe 
Hi toots 
Give us a kiss will ya 
Hey Joe 
Come on Give us a little music 
No no 
None of that slicker music 
Come on 
Come on 
Boogie it up 
Boogie it up 
Tell him to hold the boat as steady as possible 
Steady as you go Sparks 
Righto 
Saying a thing like that 
Nobody's gonna call Rosie — 
Hey Kovac 
You're a no good heel 
Take his backrest away 
All right 
Look alive now Sparks Righto 
Bring more bandages 
Joe 
Mr Kovac 
Keep her steady you fool 
Open 
Stay 
Three cards 
Bet one 
Call 
Nines 
Queens 
Okay cut 'em 
Two more cards darling 
You know by golly the thing that got me — 
Play cards Ritt 
Say what are you two gabbing about 
Currents 
Not the pie kind darling the ocean kind 
Fascinating subject currents 
They're either for you or agin you 
Connie darling do you stay or do you pass 
Oh Connie 
Hold your horses darling 
I'm in a conference 
Women and poker 
We got a favouring breeze too 
Good 
Then we ought to be in Bermuda in no time 
I hope so for Gus's sake 
That is if we're on the right course 
Well does he still think we're not 
One can't be sure without a compass 
I wonder what made him change his mind 
We've been through all that 
Is he in quarantine 
Tell him to get back to the bow 
I'll do nothing of the sort 
Wait a minute Kovac 
There's no sense treating the man like a leper 
He did save Gus's life you know 
For the time being 
After all it was an emergency operation 
Then why not listen to somebody who knows 
How do you like that 
Now he isn't sure 
Says he won't take responsibility 
But that's not the point 
The point is are we headed for Bermuda 
What's come over the man 
All you got to do is answer yes or no 
He admits we're on the wrong course 
Admits 
He's only saying what he said before 
I had to drag it out of him He says — 
I don't care what he says 
Yeah but suppose he's right 
That's my funeral 
No it's not 
It's Gus's funeral 
Whose funeral 
Hey wait a minute 
What is this 
Well fella how do you feel now huh 
In the pink 
Outside of a little hangover 
Here darling 
Guess maybe I lost a little weight huh 
You'll be all right Gus 
He did a swell job 
Well skipper how soon do we get to Bermuda 
Pretty soon Gus 
We've got a good breeze and a favouring current 
Trouble is I'm not sure about our course 
I'm only sure of one thing 
I don't trust that Nazi 
He knows where that is too 
That's how I stand 
You agree with me Sparks 
Well 
Does anybody agree with me 
You're the skipper 
All right Sparks 
Follow the German's course 
I uh was admiring your bracelet 
Gift from a husband 
It's gorgeous 
My first husband 
Glad the freighter was torpedoed 
What 
That's what you said yesterday 
That was a stupid thing to say 
I didn't mean it exactly 
What did you mean exactly 
I only meant I was rather glad that we 
What are you afraid of in London Myself 
I mean uh it's a personal problem 
In other words I 
I know darling I know 
Genus Homo 
Male 
And married but not to me 
You call that a problem 
It is to me 
Fiddlesticks 
'Course I don't know who the guy is 
But I know men especially married men 
Some of my best friends — 
Don't let her upset you 
She certainly has a way of getting at things 
That's right 
I didn't mind her prying really 
I wanted to talk 
I think I'd rather tell you than anybody 
His name is Stephen 
He's a doctor 
We worked in the same hospital 
All the time I knew he was married 
So you see it was hopeless 
It was quite hopeless 
Yes of course I 
I see 
Well we both decided to forget about it 
I was really glad 
I tried to forget him but I couldn't 
He wrote several times 
I never answered 
And then when I was assigned to London myself 
I'm sorry 
Sometimes that programme's funny 
Sometimes it isn't a bit 
Thank you Stanley 
Lovely night we're having 
Lots of stars out tonight 
I remember the night before we was torpedoed 
Nolan was — He was my first 
Yes I met him on the boat 
That's right 
Yes 
And how it's changed since the war 
He told me that 
I saw the planet Mars low on the horizon 
That's Mars over there to the right 
And that's Venus 
We're headed for Venus We're going East 
We're not heading for Bermuda 
We're heading to miss Bermuda 
Well we'll see about that 
After all we did have to drag it out of 
That's part of the trick 
He made suckers out of all of us 
He might have been mistaken 
He said one couldn't be sure without a compass 
We'll get nothing but lies 
That's what he was brought up on 
What do you want me to do 
Appoint one of us to be his lawyer 
But don't you see without a compass 
Yes Did he ask you the time 
Of course he did 
That's funny 
What's funny about it 
He had a watch of his own 
Well what of it 
That doesn't prove anything 
Lots of people do that It just uh 
It just saves time that's all 
Perhaps his own watch stopped 
Is it a crime to ask for the time 
Certainly not 
What time is it 
Ten past 7:00 
I think you're slow 
Slow 
That's a Philippe Patek 
Well why don't you wake him up and ask him 
Don't have to wake him up 
Not with Joe around 
Joe Yeah 
Operate 
Huh 
Do your stuff 
What stuff 
I don't know what you mean 
Frisk him for his turnip 
I cut that stuff out a long time ago 
Understand what 
Joe used to be one of the best all around — 
Now wait a minute Gus 
That's all right Joe 
Some of my best friends are — 
I know but I made a pledge a solemn pledge 
Do you wanna commit mutiny 
Is it an order 
It's an order 
Oh I can't 
The guy's asleep 
That's a break isn't it 
Only get the ticker 
Kovac 
Looks like quite a blow 
Pardon me I'm sorry 
Now you know the right time 
Dirty double crossing rat 
Kovac what are you gonna do 
What do you think we're gonna do 
Don't say we 
I'll not consent to a thing like this 
I'm not consulting you 
There's only one thing to do with the guy 
But Kovac it's it's murder 
It's execution 
No we can't We mustn't 
There must be some other way 
Why can't we tie him up keep a watch on him 
Let him have it Kovac 
Right now 
I'm not defending the man 
But why can't we wait till it's night 
Then in the morning — 
What are you so squeamish about 
We're at war 
You've seen 'em killed haven't you 
In battle yes But not in cold blood like this 
Look out 
Stanley 
You fools Stop thinking of yourselves 
Think of the boat 
Joe take the sheet 
Make it fast 
Kovac man the pump 
The rest of you bail 
What do you know 
Never mind about that baggage 
Start bailing 
You speak English 
Of course I speak English 
Can we stay afloat 
Those buoyancy tanks'll hold us up Oh 
My suitcase 
Get that somebody Rittenhouse 
Lash down that food 
There go our rations 
There goes our water supply 
Look out 
We might as well go down together eh Connie 
How am I doin' Willi 
Fine Ritt 
You didn't make a single mistake hardly 
Yeah I know what you mean Right in here 
Yeah that's it 
Ritt you're a born accompanist 
We're all born accompanists 
How'd I do Willi 
What are you laughing at you silly goon 
That's one for the book your book 
Only when you write it they won't believe it 
Our enemy our prisoner of war 
Tell 'em Willi 
Tell 'em how funny it is 
That isn't funny 
It's logical 
Certainly 
It's perfectly logical 
The supply ship was our only chance 
You know how I feel about that 
I'd rather take my chances with the sharks 
But he'll never make it 
Long enough Mr Kovac to reach my objective 
Are you sure Willi 
That's not necessary 
Maybe I can take over for a while 
Never mind I'll row 
The rest of us can hardly lift an oar 
It's the master race The Herrenvolk 
Didn't you know they can do anything 
I'm beginning to believe it 
Right living is what does it 
Yes I spent some time in Paris 
Oh yes 
Tell me Willi 
Wie geht's Herr Schmidt 
Name is Smith All right Mr Smith 
How do you feel today 
Same as yesterday Thirsty 
Well steward anything from the commissary yet 
Not even a nibble 
Well keep on trying 
Water 
There's that cloud 
What a day for a ball game 
St Louis's the team to watch this year 
If we only had some bait 
St Louis's got hitters 
It's been there all day 
Stan Musial's been cloutin' 'em out 
How about Ty Cobb 
He's pretty good too 
Yeah 
Pittsburgh's the team to watch 
Only 17 points below St Louis 
Hey Kovac 
Yeah 
Yeah 
Probably Sewell Gus 
I think I'll take Rosie 
Where to Gus 
It's gonna be a good game this afternoon 
He's off the beam again 
Well Willi how about another song eh 
Certainly my friend 
What would you like to hear 
Sure sure Which one was that 
♪ Dada di dadi dada Oh yeah 
I know that one all right 
Now wait a minute 
All right 
I got it 
♪ Da da da ba bum barump 
Ritt 
Huh 
You mean uh How can I leave 
That's right 
Sure 
Stanley why do you like to do that 
I don't know 
I can't sing anymore 
Makes me dry 
At the centre a bit 
Those really are rain clouds this time 
I hope so For Gus's sake 
That's right 
Why don't you give me a break Lu 
The salt'll only make you thirstier 
You might just as well sip poison 
Was she the last or the first 
What was her name 
You may call me Connie 
You did once during the storm remember 
You said uh 
We might as well go down together eh Connie 
I liked the way you said Connie 
It was like a sock in the jaw 
Tell me about the bracelet 
What'd you pay for the bracelet 
Nothing 
Barter 
Maybe that's why I'm attracted to you 
Maybe that's why you're attracted to me 
Quit slumming 
Funny part of it is I'm from the same gutter 
Well I came from there too 
South Side 
Ashland Avenue 
back of the yards 
And I lived there until I got this 
It worked miracles for me 
It took me from the uh 
South Side to the North Side 
It got me everything I wanted 
up to now 
Quit slumming 
How about a few hands Ritt Huh 
Suits me fine 
Do this up for me 
Connie I'll fix it for you 
Come on Ritt 
Kovac how much do I owe you 
Twelve thousand bucks 
Merely temporary my friend 
I'll get it back 
Deal 'em 
Looks like bits of ice 
I wish they were 
Quite so if you want to be scientific about it 
I'm a great believer in science 
Like tears for instance 
He likes you but he hates the bracelet 
You will have to get rid of it 
The bracelet 
Mm hmm I've worn it for 15 years 
Had the best restaurant in the world 
that was food for you 
There it's fixed 
In Munich there is a place called Lorber's 
Their specialty is pot roast 
Pot roast 
Young's used to have a menu 150 pages long 
Ever eat in Antoine's in New Orleans 
Can't compare with Young's 
You never tasted such food in your life 
Especially seafood 
Ritt shut up 
What's wrong 
Stop jabbering about food 
Carelessness 
Yes stupid criminal carelessness 
The commissary was Joe's job 
Maybe it was my f— 
No it wasn't 
You should have seen the storm coming 
My dear Connie what's the matter with you 
She's all right Just a little bit hungry 
What are you squawking about 
It'll make a swell chapter 
If you really come from back of the yard 
Kovac why don't you kill Willi 
I'll tell you why 
You're not strong enough 
Does it annoy you 
Well it makes me feel good 
Oh you feel good do you That's fine 
Fine 
Ritt how much money are you worth

I have a full house 
And I had four deuces 
How do I know you had four deuces 
You ought to know 
You made the cards didn't you 
And you marked 'em too 
They are crooked and you are crooked 
It's raining 
It's raining 
It's raining 
Get the sail 
Here 
That's right 
I was at the wheel when she hit 
When she keeled over 
Like a human being she was screamin' 
Right to the end 
I looked up 
A couple of drops fell right on my lips 
Hey Joe 
What's the matter 
Why have you stopped playin' 
Come on 
Heat it up 
Give it the Harry James 
Gee Rosie 
You're an armful 
An armful of honey that's what you are 
Say Rosie I'm thirsty 
How about a drink 
Set 'em up Pete 
Nice tall ones 
Plenty of ice 
Here's to you Rosie baby 
What is it Gus 
Willi's got some water 
That's right Gus 
I just had a tall one plenty of ice 
Sure Gus 
Sure 
But Willi only had water That's right 
Uh I guess I'll get back to Rosie 
Willi where'd you get the water 
You've been holdin' out on us 
You mustn't wake up the others 
They are tired 
Well what about you 
Ain't you tired No 
Me neither 
I feel fine except my right foot's asleep 
I can hardly feel it 
Willi tell me 
Yeah but 
warning can I 
I got to find some way to 
to break it to her gentle 
It'll be all right 
Okay 
So long Willi 
Good bye Gus 
I'll never forget what you done for me 
There is something you can do for me 
Remember your name is Schmidt 
You like it better than Smith 
Much better 
You'd better hurry Gus She's waiting 
Okay 
Why didn't you share it with us 
Shh 
You mustn't wake them 
Okay Willi 
Why don't you go after Rosie 
She's waiting for you at Roseland 
There Do you see the lights 
Help 
Stanley 
Help 
Stanley 
Stanley 
Willi he's got 
Help 
Where's Gus 
He's gone over 
No use Stan 
Gus 
He went under 
Gus 
Willi what is it What's happened 
Schmidt went over the side 
He was calling my name 
That's what woke me 
You can't imagine how painful it was to me 
Why didn't you stop rowing 
Why should I 
To help him 
The best way to help him was to let him go 
I had no right to stop him even if I wanted to 
A poor cripple dying of hunger and thirst 
What good could life be to a man like that 
He was trying to tell me something 
If I could only remember 
He's better off now out of his trouble 
Something about water 
He was in agony from thirst 
I wanted to cry but the tears wouldn't come 
No how could they 
Isn't that so Willi 
Ja 
What about sweat 
What's the chemical composition of sweat 
Water with a trace of something or other 
Now I remember 
Gus said Willi had some water 
Yeah 
Right under his shirt 
Quite so 
And I had food tablets and energy pills too 
To survive one must have a plan 
But there's nothing to worry about 
Too bad Schmidt couldn't have waited 
You 
Please don't Please Miss Alice 
To my dying day I'll never understand Willi 
Or what he did 
You would've thought he'd have been grateful 
All he could do was to plot against us 
Then he 
He let poor old Gus die of thirst 
What do you do with people like that 
Maybe one of us ought to try to row 
Where to 
What for 
Nah 
When we killed the German we killed our motor 
No 
We still got a motor 
Eh 
Who 
Nah 
We're through 
Are you afraid 
No 
I don't think so 
If we had got out of it I 
I was going to ask you to marry me 
What do you think you'd have said 
I think I would've said yes 
Well then whatever happens 
I'd like you to marry me 
Congratulations 
Well that's settled 
And what now little men 
I've been a widower for 18 years 
We never had any children 
I hope they do somebody some good 
My only regret is that in the end 
I joined a mob 
Baloney 
We weren't a mob when we killed him 
Good grief look at you 
Made of what 
I'll write your epitaph for you now 
Ritt he quit 
That goes for you too Narcissus 
And you Joe 
How about giving him a hand 
What's the matter with us 
Ye Gods and little fishes 
Fishes 
Ye Gods 
Well why don't we catch some 
We tried that 
We have no bait 
Sure we have bait: by Cartier 
Are you kidding 
Kidding my foot 
I'm starving 
Well what are you waiting around for 
Where's the fish line 
Bait your line chum 
Not only food but oil 
We can squeeze the fish for oil 
It's better than water 
I can recommend the bait 
I ought to know 
I bit on it myself 
I've never eaten raw fish before 
I have 
It's not bad 
What do you mean chickens 
Strike 
It's a good one 
Careful 
Easy 
Easy does it 
Don't let him have slack Easy 
There's a ship 
Huh 
Gangway Why you 
My bracelet 
It's the supply ship all right 
Yeah 
Willi's had the last word at that 
Do you suppose they'll have any coffee aboard 
Real coffee 
Hello 
What'd he say 
He says yes they have some coffee 
Look 
The supply ship's signalling 
What's happening 
Why are they turning around 
Maybe they forgot the cream for the coffee 
They're not going to pick us up Hey 
Well that's that's impossible 
They can't leave us here like this Why 
Why that's inhuman 
And now there's a storm coming up 
No that's gunfire 
Do you know I 
They're shooting at us 
What's the matter with them 
With what 
Where are we going 
What's the best place to go 
She's moving towards us 
Can't you boys row any faster 
In a word wow 
They've got her 
Watch your head 
She's going down 
And fast too 
Not fast enough for me 
Well that settles the score 
Here comes our ship 
She ought to be here in about 20 minutes 
What can we use to signal with 
Wait'll she gets a little nearer 
There I go again

Don't I hear any more fortune 
No 
You can go now 
Thank you 
I'll try it 
I would like to buy another chance Bravo 
That's a splendid idea 
Splendid 
I would say 4 pounds 15 and a half ounces 
Anybody could tell you're a bachelor 
As a matter of fact the gentleman has won it 
He's not more than a fraction of an ounce out 
You'd better not eat too much 
It'll be heavy as lead 
On the contrary it's made with real eggs 
There you are 
Thank you Thank you 
Hoo hoo 
Hoo hoo 
Oh the gentleman with the cake please wait 
I've made a mistake about the weight 
I'm so sorry but it wasn't what you said 
The real weight is three pounds and two ounces 
The other gentleman won it What gentleman 
There with Mrs Bellane 
What did he guess 
Oh much closer 
Three pounds and eight ounces 
Good night 
You don't find many good cakes these days 
I told you it'd be worthwhile 
I hope our lads give 'em a proper pasting' 
Well good night sir Good night Thank you

This is Travers Brathwaite 
Your suit was dispatched an hour ago sir 
I trust in time for your journey 
Oh it isn't a matter of coupons sir 
The manufacturers have no more of the pattern 
Personally I have no hope sir 
No hope at all Gentlemen what is it 
Prentice 
Excuse me 
That's Travers Travers huh 
Travers What happened 
Hello 
Is anyone there 
Oh 
Oh 
Why didn't you deliver Mr Macklin's suit 
I did just before I came here 
You must have gotten to the wrong address 
That's all right then 
Mr Travers was quite put out 
Oh 
Neale 
Why Carla said come in here man 
We thought you'd been killed 
Not quite 
What happened 
Is she here 
Yes 
Carla 
Carla 
yes 
He isn't a ghost You'd better tell her 
Why did you come here 
Why not 
He gives the orders not Dr Forrester 
Tsk tsk tsk There wasn't much else to do 
It was too good a charity to lose 
And you'd kill your sister to save it 
You killed your wife 
We've always been very close 
I was really happy when I found her alive 
Put your hat and coat on We are leaving 
The trouble with me is I like people too much 
I was quite happy letting you hit me on the jaw 
I'm fond of that memory myself 
But you are a persistent man Neale 
Are you ready Carla 
Yes 
Oh yes Cost said the shoulders would settle 
Killing me won't get you out of England Hilfe 
You're through 
Give me the gun Carla 
Give me the coat 
You wouldn't shoot your brother Carla 
Come 
They're on the stairs 
Can you make it 
Yes 
Come on 
Turn out the lights down there 
Are they coming 
I don't know 
Give me the other magazine out of the coat 
I've always dreamed of having a church wedding 
Maybe you don't think murder looks good on you 
Maybe I didn't do it Maybe he didn't do it 
Look Marlowe we're arraigning you 
We don't like you but it ain't personal 
We just follow a routine after a killing 
Where's Randall 
He asked us to talk to you if that's okay 
Is he holding the kid 
I wouldn't know 
Is she all right 
I wouldn't know that either 
Where did you see her last 
I forget 
How do you feel 
Like a duck in a shooting gallery 
Cigarette Yeah Thanks 
Want to make a statement 
You got a rope under my ears 
I think you better let me have it 
Okay Dowling Bring in your notebook 
We're all set 
The works 
Yeah 
Some of it you know If I misquote you 
Let's get it on the record from the beginning 
With Malloy then 
It was about 7:00 Anyway it was dark 
Why were you at the office that late 
I'm a homing pigeon 
And I never found him 
My feet hurt 
And my mind felt like a plumber's handkerchief 
Not quite real 
I seen your name on the blackboard downstairs 
Yeah 
I come up to see you 
You're a private eye 
That's right 
I'd like you to look for somebody 
Okay Tomorrow 
I'd like to show you where she worked 
Okay You show me where she worked 
This way 
Nothing bothered me 
They changed it a lot 
She was cute as lace pants 
A redhead 
Eight years since I seen her 
Six she didn't write but she'll have a reason 
What's she do sing 
Yeah 
Let's you and me go up and nibble a couple 
Boss 
Whiskey 
Call yours 
Whiskey 
You never heard of Velma 
Look Joe I'm sorry about your girl 
And I know how you feel but she ain't here 
No girl's been here since I owned this place 
No show 
No noise 
I got a reputation for no trouble 
She used to work here 
You ask him about Velma 
We've been over all that Drink up Joe 
You remember Velma 
Some guys has the wrong ideas when to get fancy 
Whiskey 
Who asked you to stick your face in 
You did Remember me 
I'm the guy who came in with you chunky 
Moose Malloy You heard of me maybe 
Maybe 
They changed it a lot 
You said that 
I'm beginning not to like it here 
Maybe I told you too much No 
We was to be married What happened 
I put away a few grand before I went up 
Just a couple of overnight stops 
Okay 
You find Velma 
She got a last name 
Velma 
Velma Valento 
How will I get in touch with you 
I get in touch with you 
I spent a buck in another bar for some history 
Mike Florian ran the joint until 1939 
His wife Jessie finished it for him 
Tracing her was easy I could do that 
He needed a private detective 
I gave her a drink 
What was it we was talking about 
The red headed girl named Velma Valento 
Who was it you said you was mister 
There 
A private cop 
Do you remember Velma 
Who was that copper 
Velma 
No 
I don't seem to right off 
What was it you said you wanted her for 
I'm tracing her for a client of mine 
I got an idea 
No peeking 
Publicity that is 
Why did you hide this picture of Velma 
Why did you hide it 
Give it to me 
She's dead 
She was a nice kid but she's dead 
Yeah he's out 
He's out and he's looking for his girl 
Why did you hide her picture 
Beat it 
I don't know anybody by the name of Moose 
Suddenly she wasn't drunk anymore 
Hello sweetheart 
I let in a guy a couple hours ago 
He said it was important 
Okay 
Cute little fella isn't he 
Yeah 
Sober 
Yeah 
He smells real nice 
Mr Marlowe 
I took the liberty of waiting here Mr Marlowe 
Who put in the pitch for me Mr Marriott 
I beg your pardon 
How did you get my name 
As a matter of fact 
I'm in a clutch at the moment 
What's the job 
I'm meeting some men shortly after midnight 
I'm paying them some money 
What's the deal blackmail 
How much and what for 
I can't go into that 
You just want me to go along and hold your hand 
I'm afraid I don't like your manner 
How much are you offering me for doing nothing 
How would you like a swift punch on the nose 
I tremble at the thought of such violence 
I'm offering $100 for a few hours of your time 
If that isn't enough say so There's no risk 
I'm buying them back Where and when 
Wait a minute 
We were watched 
I didn't see anything I felt it in my stomach 
I was a toad on a wet rock 
A snake was looking at the back of my neck 
Check: White posts 
You sit tight I'll go down and have a look see 
Looks like a tryout to see if you obey orders 
I caught the blackjack right behind my ear 
A black pool opened up at my feet 
I dived in It had no bottom 
I felt pretty good 
like an amputated leg 
Are you all right 
What happened 
Sorry I don't have it 
Suppose they ran out of uses for him 
They might try to hang a murder around his neck 
Great 
Look I try to be helpful 
I tell you all I know four times 
It sounds screwy All right it is screwy 
Sometimes I'm not smart but it's all I know 
I'm tired of listening to your bum guesses 
Either book me or let me go home 
I get it You don't like me No 
You'd slit your own throat for six bits 
Now look 
All I want from you is silence 
I'll get them their murderer 
Okay Go on home to bed 
Stick to your story if you want 
And stay out of the way of Marriott's pals 
Yeah 
So you know him then 
Business is getting better And prettier 
Mr Marlowe I'm Miss Allison The Post 
How did you know about me 
I'd just get you in a lot of trouble 
Come in Miss Allison Have a seat 
Had you known Marriott some time 
A couple of weeks 
One or two 
You do your own typing Miss Allison 
Why yes 
I'm not always this brilliant Miss 
Miss Grayle 
But I'm improving 
What do you do besides playing reporter 
Who does it belong to 
What's your interest in it 
I'll take my answer first Okay 
The jade belongs to my father 
Now unlock the door 
I got it from Marriott it belonged to a lady 
My father happens to be married 
Yes of course he would be 
She's not my mother 
Which one sent you here to feel me out 
It was my own brilliant idea 
Open the door 
It was a nice little front yard 
Mr Marlowe 
Mr Marlowe Father 
How do you do How are you 
It's good of you to come 
This is Mrs Grayle 
Are you familiar with jade Mr Marlowe 
What do you know about jade 
It's green isn't it 
Yeah 
No thanks 
The great rulers of the East however 
Sit down won't you Thank you 
I'm afraid like most old men with a hobby 
I'm inclined to be a bit of a bore 
Keep going 
I was already in it up to my eyebrows 
A necklace Mr Marlowe 
A necklace 60 beads of about six carats each 
Worth how much 
That's difficult to say 
Something like that 
It's unanswerable 
I shouldn't have 
I never should have worn it out 
If you'll excuse me I'm feeling a little tired 
Goodbye sir 
Yeah So do I 
Would you mind 
No Not at all 
I stir up trouble on the side 
How much money was in Marriott's envelope 
$8 000 
Cheap at the price Dirt cheap 
We guessed they didn't know its real value 
Besides I trust her Why 
I don't know I trust some people 
I trust you Did you trust Marriott 
I thought detectives were heavy drinkers 
Some of them are 
Shall I tell you about the holdup 
It might help 
Where were you stopped 
Near here 
Does it matter a lot 
Not too much at the moment 
How many other Marriotts are there: 
Pretty guys who take you dancing 
I'm very fond of my husband 
Only his two step's getting a little stiff 
Do you know a Jules Amthor 
I've heard Lin speak of him Why 
I don't know 
Is he a bad boy 
A lot of Lin's friends are I'm afraid 
How 
With a sap only good 
How awful 
I don't understand 
I'm not sure 
That's why he went to him originally 
He couldn't get started for fear of failure 
I wonder if he'd take my case 
Who was that 
Ann 
Strange child 
You will help me won't you 
As much as the traffic will bear 
When can you start 
I've already started 
Yes 
Show him in 
How do you spend your evenings 
And then where do you go 
I'm in the book 
Let's see what's on his mind 
I'm sorry 
This is Mr Marlowe Mr Amthor 
I was hired as a bodyguard and bungled the job 
Now I'm investigating myself 
These things are so difficult to believe 
Close friend someone you know so well 
What could have happened 
I've got a couple of notions 
When could you help me work them out 
I know 
You are inaccessible 
In what way do you think I could help you 
You look harmless to me 
I'd be glad to arrange an interview if 
Just leave the number with Mrs Grayle 
How do you get out of this funhouse 
This way sir 
Come in 
It's on the bed 
You must be in love 
Bring it back tomorrow 
You've got a nice build for a private detective 
It gets me around 
How does one get to be a private detective 
You don't mind my sizing you up a little 
Shall we call this a retainer 
Yeah let's call it a retainer 
If the cops get to you you sent for me 
You hired me Do they have to know about me 
Would that bother you 
We live pretty much by ourselves 
He's not very strong 
I'll manage it How did it go with Amthor 
I'm stubborn 
I don't like being rushed 
Not in public It's too crowded 
Do you like the Coconut Beach Club 
Never been there I'm the drive in type 
The lights would be flattering to you 
They might even mellow you a little 
Be right with you 
Mr Marlowe 
Look 
I like you but I'm too old to play games 
There's no danger You're being sidetracked 
Helen's gone by now 
What do you mean sidetracked 
You'll find out 
I'm just staying long enough to speak my piece 
What did she ask you to do 
You missed that part 
You said you were a businessman All right 
Whatever she was willing to pay you I'll up it 
Just stay away from her Forget the whole thing 
What's the matter 
What are you looking at me like that for 
I don't know 
I seem to remember you from one of my dreams 
Stick around I'll be right back 
Ditch the babe 
What's the matter with you 
Don't you want me to have a love life 
Ditch the babe 
Soon gangrene will set in in those fingers 
I'd like you to meet a guy Okay 
Come on 
I trust you brought your crystal ball 
I don't get it 
Or is that only true in rental fiction 
I'd like you to ask him now 
Don't be impatient Ask me what 
Can't you do your own asking 
Take it easy big boy 
Where did you pick up Malloy 
My dear Mr Marlowe 
A characteristic of your generation 
Now about the police 
It's an old psychological trick grandpa 
What's your racket 
I am in a very sensitive profession 
I am a quack 
That is it 
My theory's pretty simple It goes like this: 
But he wasn't the whole works 
And that is your picture of Marriott and me 
I am slightly disgusted and very disappointed 
I am very disappointed in you 
You depress me 
Suppose your theory were correct 
I would have Mrs Grayle's jade now wouldn't I 
He might get ambitious 
Could be if he had it 
How big a consideration 
You wouldn't suggest that 
There's really no need for subterfuge 
I want that jade 
You get him to tell you yet 
He refuses to tell me where she is 
I gave you some dough to find Velma 
Take it easy We'll get it out of him 
How'd you get mixed up with these guys 
What's the connection 
He's okay He tells me about you 
He just picked you up to do his dirty work 
He's after jewelry He thinks I've got it 
Ask him about Velma 
I paid you to find her Keep your shirt on 
Where you got her 
I haven't got her you nitwit 
Where's the necklace 
Tell me and I'll stop him 
Let him breathe a little 
Where's the necklace 
I haven't got it 
All right A little more 
Let him go He's tame 
I could teach you but to what purpose 
Isn't that so 
I'm glad you hit me It helps 
Helps me a great deal 
Next thing I remember I was going somewhere 
It was not my idea 
The rest of it was a crazy coked up dream 
I had never been there before 
Where's the necklace 
You shouldn't have hit me 
The window was open but the smoke didn't move 
It was a gray web woven by 1 000 spiders 
I wondered how they got them to work together 
Help 
What strikes you funny pally 
The smoke The smoke strikes you funny 
Where am I 
You like also to know where you're at 
The doors are too small 
The stairs are made of dough 
I think this guy's nuts Do you think he's nuts 
Skip it 
I wondered what I was shot full of 
Maybe both 
Okay you cuckoo walk and talk 
What about 
Anything Everything 
That's a beautiful bed 
Stay off it 
Walk 
I walked 
I don't know how long 
I didn't have a watch 
I was ready to talk to somebody 
Help 
Help 
That'll quiet your nerves pally 
The buzzer won't buy you anything tonight doc 
I just gave nursey a sleeping tablet 
I cannot recommend your being up and about 
I had a nightmare A lot of crazy things 
I slept 
I woke up and the room was full of smoke 
Here I am all cured 
What were you saying 
I made no remark 
Remarks want you to make them 
You've been suffering from narcotic poisoning 
I haven't shot a man in a week 
Also a little something to make me talk 
What was I supposed to talk about 
Maybe about a jade necklace I haven't got 
Was I good telling you about what I don't have 
Did the customers like me 
Or will Amthor be disappointed in you 
It depresses him 
You're not well Mr Marlowe 
Please give me this 
Now the gun please 
The gun please 
I strongly advise 
Tie a ribbon on the one to the front door doc 
I'm afraid you're going to faint Mr Marlowe 
Tie a ribbon on it 
The girls must have a great time with you 
I'm booked captain Look pal I 
I'm booked captain 
I'll murder you I don't like fighting 
You're nuts You're crazy as a rabbit 
He sent after me Who 
The smart thinker Amthor 
Listen I'd like you to take my friend 
I'd like you to take my friend Sure 
I said something wrong there I knew it 
His brain was working 
What do you want 
Black coffee eggs and a scotch and soda 
Go away Excuse me 
This is a nice place 
But why 
Isn't there room for you in the palace 
An old ballroom or something you could sleep in 
Or don't you like it out there 
I'm all broke up with cops honey 
What happened 
Are you all right 
He gave me a cute time for three days 
I don't think I'm supposed to be alive 
Say that again Say what again 
The last thing you said 
I said What happened 
Are you all right 
What's the matter 
I just remember how it happened 
You found out something would happen out there 
You knew they had been holding hands 
You didn't like that I didn't kill him 
Are you trying to reform her 
I hate her 
That doesn't make sense 
I just don't want anything to hurt him 
That would hurt him 
I don't buy it either yet 
Whose handwriting is this 
I found it on Marriott 
How'd you like to work for me 
I'm flattered 
But he's terrible at it 
Get rid of him 
Yes 
I'd like a word with your boyfriend 
Well I really don't 
Come in Lieutenant 
Excuse me 
The last time I saw you I gave you good advice 
I didn't get around to it He got to me 
He gave me quite a party How did it go 
What'll it buy me This is straight 
He annoyed me a little Let you have it cheap 
I just get to finish my dinner 
Okay Come in Nulty Make yourself at home 
Who owns this jade I told you 
One of Amthor's patients 
By the name of 
I don't know 
Sorry to bother you Miss Grayle 
Not for several days Is something wrong 
I might get grateful and lock you up 
How could he know about me 
I don't know 
What is it 
It's funny About every third day I get hungry 
Always have to stop and eat something 
You haven't got a razor have you 
I think I've got another one under the mattress 
He's no match for anybody Take it easy 
He must be in his workshop 
Father 
What are you going to do 
I don't know I was frightened 
I am frightened The police been here 
Yes What's it all about 
We don't know yet 
Did they talk to your wife 
No 
Has she been with you 
What did they have to say 
That probably held up Randall a couple of days 
Yeah why not 
Because it must stop 
Look pop the cops are moving now They're mad 
They're going to tag somebody 
I don't work by push buttons 
I stop and I go but I've got to have reasons 
Forgive me Mr Marlowe 
Forgive me please 
And of course my daughter here 
But my wife's the most important 
Do you find her beautiful 
Why not 
She is beautiful isn't she 
And desirable 
I've played a little game with myself 
I've enjoyed pretending that 
It's given me great happiness Pride of course 
But now I'm losing her 
I don't know why 
Because of that a man has died 
Nevertheless he's dead because of my necklace 
I don't know why But it must stop 
It must stop Mr Marlowe It must stop 
What do you want me to do about it 
I'll pay you well 
Everybody pushes me in everybody pushes me out 
Nobody wants me to do anything 
Okay Put a check in the mail 
I'll be right back Father 
Have you got a key to the beach house 
But you said 
I bowed out I stopped He thinks it's over 
Do the police stop 
Does Helen stop 
Do you stop 
What do you mean Does Helen stop 
I don't know 
If I always knew what I meant I'd be a genius 
But I know this 
You're vicious 
What you're hanging on to will smack you 
But cleaner Maybe that's why I'm sticking 
You drive 
Is that you 
Is what me 
That nice expensive smell 
Quite a lad 
Someone's been here Sure 
Mess up his house 
Here 
Does that prove something 
No 
That's what he said he did 
Or did you 
I don't know 
Yeah All I can do is keep guessing 
All I can do about you is guess 
Please let's go I'm awfully tired Okay 
Right there 
I'm a pretty good guesser 
Your father really loves Helen I can see that 
Marriott did hurt him 
I don't always guess right I may be wrong 
I think I am wrong Sometimes I hate men 
All men: 
I'm sorry darling I couldn't help laughing 
You should know by now that men play rough 
Cold like that only not that clean 
Your slip shows dear 
How long have you been here 
Since yesterday 
Please don't blame me You could've had it 
Was it bad 
It almost made me mad 
I don't lie very well do I Well 
It's a long story and not very pretty 
I got lots of time and I'm not squeamish 
I more or less figured that How does it work 
My husband is 65 He's in love with me 
I've gone out with other men 
You talk as good as I do now 
He flatters you 
He gets into your past 
You talk and talk and 
Finally he asked for the jade 
He threatened to go to my husband 
Sounds like quite a past 
I think it would kill him 
I couldn't risk it so I agreed 
Somebody who knew what he knew 
Could've been Marriott I think it was 
Could be I'm sure of it 
I'm sure Amthor decided to kill him out there 
It's rough but I'll buy it up to there 
I want you to help me kill Amthor 
It's the only way I'll ever have peace 
Why me 
Because I'm handy and know how to use a gun 
Or just because I wear pants 
Don't say that Please I need you so 
I'm lost 
I haven't been good nor halfway good 
I need you 
All right Got anything worked out 
But I can't find him 
He works at this stuff 
Make it simple 
Have I 
He won't expect you to have it on you 
For instance 
Here 
We don't play that way We just wait 
Okay he comes Then what 
That's my part 
All right I'll dig him up In the morning 
You're wonderful 
How would you like not having to earn a living 
Wouldn't bother me 
Got any ideas 
When will you be back 
He's slippery It may not be easy 
I better not come out till tomorrow night 
I went in the way I knew about 
I thought it would give him a bang 
I thought it would kill him 
He wasn't hurt much 
I got to find her now I got to go away 
Sounds like a good idea 
You find her 
Is that your girl 
That's your girl isn't it 
That's Velma 
It says Always Velma doesn't it 
I don't like nobody to kid with me 
I thought it was a phony I had to make sure 
She wasn't like that I'll tell you how she was 
Cute 
Do you want to see her before you go away 
You mean you find her now 
Yeah I find her 
Just now 
She's okay 
Depends on what you got in mind 
She's doing all right 
That depends too 
Did you tip the johns off on her 
I wouldn't want Velma to serve no stretch 
What stretch 
You two mixed up in something together 
You tipped the johns off They got her 
Listen to me and stop dancing with me 
The johns haven't got her She's got herself 
She wants to talk to you 
Okay Tomorrow 
I'd like to pay you some more for finding her 
Skip it 
Here 
Grab yourself a hamburger and lay low 
See you here tomorrow as soon as it gets dark 
You got that 
Yeah 
What do you do 
I wait here Then I come up 
When do you come up 
You open the window 
I open the curtains You'll see the light 
I'll leave the door open 
But I had to know one more thing 
I had to know how the jade figured 
You're trembling 
I was afraid something had happened 
Did you find Amthor 
Let's get set What's the program 
Pull the curtains and turn on the lights 
Don't you like it 
I don't know 
Where'd you get it 
Lower left hand drawer of my dressing table 
It was never stolen 
There wasn't any holdup 
You faked the whole thing 
I'm not going to let him get it now 
He'll never get that far 
Let's not talk about it now 
I had to pretend to buy it back 
Marriott fell for that Yes Why not 
I didn't really like him 
He wasn't any good 
But remembering does something to my stomach 
You still think Amthor killed him 
Who else 
You 
No 
No you can't mean that 
Why 
I think the picture was a little different 
He had to help you to protect his interest 
You knew that 
They didn't want me cutting in either 
He might even have hurt you 
Nifty thinking 
Either way you had us separated 
Please don't 
It's all true 
I can't go back now 
I'm so close to peace so close 
Just Amthor 
But I can't face it alone 
Don't desert me now 
Sorry 
It won't work twice 
It's a good technique but it won't work twice 
I don't count the first time eight years ago 
I don't know what you talked him into 
Was it murder or something serious 
It wasn't just men Pop understood the men 
It was the clink coming up 
It's no good understanding the clink 
You still don't get silk sheets 
Don't do that 
It leaves a bruise 
I'll try to remember that 
I could like you 
I could like you a lot 
It's too bad it has to be like this 
Don't move 
Come in 
I wanted to spare you 
I might have been able to help prevent all this 
Now of course it's too late 
I think perhaps you'd better do it quickly 
Get his gun 
What's your first name 
Philip for short 
Philip Marlowe 
A name for a duke 
And you're just a nice mug 
I've got a name for a duchess: 
Mrs Lewin Lockridge Grayle 
Just a couple of mugs 
We could have got along 
What's stopping us now 
I can handle Moose He's in love with you 
Then that leaves only you 
You know too much 
It's gone too far and I'm so tired 
Let's have the police 
Don't you realize he saved your life 
Why must he suffer for that 
Why must he suffer more 
The cops like to solve murders done with my gun 
She's dead 
Isn't that enough 
She was evil all evil 
You don't call me I hear it so I come up 
I'd like to talk to Velma now 
It didn't work out the way I planned Moose 
You got a refund coming 
She ain't hardly changed 
Just like always only more fancy 
Cute as lace pants always 
It was the only thing I could do 
You must try and understand 
I couldn't let her go 
I loved her too much 
You shouldn't have killed her 
It was blacker than the others and deeper 
I didn't expect to hit bottom 
I thought I was full of lead 
That's all I know 
It wasn't the kid was it It wasn't Ann 
Randall 
He'll be back in a minute 
A couple months if you live that long 
You mean I'm sprung

I didn't say 
She here now 
No Okay Nulty See that he gets home 
You give going away presents here 
That's yours She gave it to you didn't she 
She was going to but I didn't finish the job 
What am I supposed to do with it 
Give it to your girlfriend 
Give it back to China 
Strangle yourself with it I don't care 
How'd she take it about the old man 
I wouldn't know 
Cute figure huh 
Not a beautiful face but a good face 
A face like a Sunday school picnic 
You know what kind of a face that is 
I wouldn't know 
It's too bad I had to push her around 
I wonder how she figured me Not much probably 
Probably thought there was more 
I'd like to tell her 
I wouldn't know 
Hey cab 
Watch your head 
1800 South Kingsley Right

You're crazy I can hardly reel it in 
Maybe he's dead 
Maybe But he's still jumping out there 
Come on Hurry up 
I'm hurrying Mr Johnson 
Can't you put bait on like that Captain

He's necessary Aren't you Horatio 
I hope so 
Can't Eddie do it 
No he can't 
What's the matter 
He just lost a fish 
Mr Johnson you're unlucky 
Would it be all right if I

Thanks 
I don't see why you want that rummy around 
He's no good now

No 
What do you look after him for 
He thinks he's looking after me 
All right let her run 
Mr Johnson

Okay forget it 
What about tomorrow 
You're just unlucky I never seen no one 
Shut up Eddie 
You said 16 days I only owe you for 15 
The tackle's your risk 
Not when you lose it like you did 
I paid to rent it every day It's your risk 
Not if he was in it 
That's a good one 
That's good Eddie 
You lost the outfit through carelessness 
It cost me $275 
And there's 16 days at $35 a day that's $560 
No it's $560 Eddie

Come on 
What are you talking about 
Mister what's got into you 
What do you think you're gonna do 
I'm gonna get that wallet Slim 
I'd rather you wouldn't call me Slim 
I'm a little too skinny to take it kindly 
Quit the baby talk 
Which is it 
You know Steve I wouldn't put it past you 
I didn't know you were a hotel detective 
Johnson's my client 
He doesn't speak so well of you 
He's still my client 
He dropped it and I picked it up 
You were gonna give it back to him of course 
No I wasn't 
I don't like him 
That's a pretty good reason 
How do you like that 
Find anything 
Do you expect more 
That bird owed me $825 
I haven't got that much on me he says 
So he was gonna skip out on you 
Your client 
Good thing you didn't give it back to him 
Then I did you a favor 
That's right 
After all I am entitled to something 
Don't you think so Slim 
What do you think is fair 
I'll leave that to you 
What would you say to 
Please Harry I told them but they insisted 
It is not Gerard's fault Mr Morgan 
Come in and close the door 
I know But close the door please 
I'm very sorry to intrude this way 
but this is of great importance and we 
One moment 
I'd better go 
See you later 
Stick around We're not through yet 
Go ahead 
But it's no good 
If you'd listen 
No use 
You're taking a chance coming here 
We're not afraid 
I am I'm sorry I can't and won't do it 
We'll give you 2 500 francs 
That's only $50 in American money 
It is more to us 
We'd give you more money but we can't 
It's all we have 
Yes I know 
I'm not that friendly to anybody 
But they wouldn't do that to an American 
Do you really think that 
Who's that 
It's me Harry 
It's all right 
Hi Harry How you been keeping 
Hello Eddie 
I wanted to talk to you about

Eddie's a friend of mine 
He was hanging around the dock after you left 
You have a good memory for one who drinks 
I couldn't You see 
I'd start drinking water again 
Maybe you'd forget about water too 
No I wouldn't I see too much of it 
Was you ever bit by a dead bee 
Were you 
Right You Harry and Frenchy 
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way 
You have

Does he always talk so much 
Always

You mean he had rented it 
There was no money on him or in his wallet 
Only some American travelers checks 
Was that customary with him 
There was $60 in it 
What happened to it 
I took it 
Why 
Because he owed me $825 
So it would seem 
But unfortunately for you someone did 
That's right 
You have this money now 
If you please 
This is mine 
How do we know that 
Thank you Do not be concerned

That is your privilege 
By the way what are your sympathies

And you can have it if you want it 
That's right 
Most of the time The other times

What did you do that for 
I've been wondering whether I'd like it

I don't know yet 
It's even better when you help 
Sure you won't change your mind about this 
I do 
Okay

Why don't you shave and we'll try it again 
Harry wait 
I can't do that I got to shave 
He's got Eddie 
He's giving him drinks and asking him questions 
I was afraid of that 
Good thing you didn't get me in that tub 
Strings 
I didn't see any strings 
You ought to have seen that fish 
It must have weighed 900 if it weighed a pound 
You know a marlin is a swordfish 
Good morning Capitaine 
Hello Harry How's everything 
Fine 
Won't you join us 
It's a little early for this kind of a party 
Continue Mr Eddie 
Did you hear that He called me mister 
Say you're all right 
Was you ever bit by a 
No he never was Eddie 
Go on with what you were saying 
That's right Eddie 
It was after dark and we was still playing him 
He must have weighed at least 1 000 easy 
He must have started with a pretty small one 
We didn't didn't he tell you 
We ran into a German submarine 
A German submarine 
I didn't wait to find out 
I do not think 
You know you can't be too careful these days 
Not to speak of shooting out their searchlight 
Patrol boat 
Yes 
That's what it was You were right Eddie 
I'm a good man in the dark always was 
What's that 
Don't you ever ask any questions 
Don't you ever talk 
No I guess you don't What were you saying 
He does if he likes it and we do don't we 
Yeah remember in Key West when we went 
We don't seem to be getting anywhere 
It was the Fourth of July 
What about your passengers 
It was 7:00 
What about your two passengers 
What passengers 
The ones you brought from Anguilla 
He was waiting on the dock when we came in 
You think I got them ashore in my sleeve 
Right I could've at that 
Would $500 refresh your memory 
My memory's pretty good 
Does that include the $825 Johnson owed me 
Why not 
And the $500 you just mentioned 
they're gonna be pretty hard to find 
Not for a man of your resourcefulness 
Think it over and let me hear from you 
Did you hear all of that 
Most of it 
Bee lips went away pretty mad 
He thinks now that you will turn them in 
Isn't that what you want him to think 
What will happen then 
He hasn't searched this hotel yet has he 
Not yet 
There's your answer 
He doesn't want them but the whole setup 
What shall we do 
It's not we it's you 
Until then you're probably safe 
Better get rid of this 
Bring us some breakfast 
Sure 
I thought you didn't want any breakfast 
I didn't then 
What were you saying Eddie 
I've been figuring 
They don't know me do they Harry 
I think they're trying to find out something 
What do you suppose it is 
Don't you know 
I ain't got no idea 
Have I Harry 
Yeah I never noticed 
You better take a drink of water 
What water 
No not that 
It'll do you good 
I'll be all right 
Eddie 
Yeah Harry 
Keep out of sight and stay away from the police 
What story was that Harry 
Keep out of sight 
Seen Eddie around 
Where's Frenchy 
I'm going to work Do you like it 
You won't have to sing much in that outfit 
You know sometimes you make me 
That's why I do it 
Haven't seen Eddie have you 
No not since noon why 
He left the boat and hasn't come back 
Is there anything wrong 
I don't know 
Stick around awhile she's going to sing 
I'll be right back 
Give her my love 
I'd give her my own if she had that on 
I could use a drink Cricket 
Sure come on 
What will you have Slim 
Scotch and soda 
Same 
Good evening 
Good evening Capt Morgan 
How are you feeling 
Much better I'm very grateful to you 
Forget it Let me have a look at this 
There's no bleeding 
No 
Does that hurt 
Very little 
You won't need me anymore 
When 
Soon as I find Eddie 
Is your friend missing 
Yeah 
What happened 
Usually does what I tell him 
I'm sorry if anything happened 
I won't know until I find him 
Couldn't you leave him here 
I don't think Eddie would like that 
Wouldn't it be best if we went with you 
Why do you want to go 
Why'd you come here in the first place 
Have you heard of Pierre Villemars 
Pierre Villemars 
Yeah I read a headline He was quite a guy 
Vichy got him He's dead isn't he 
No 
He's on Devil's Island 
Just how are you gonna get him away 
You don't think much of me Capt Morgan 
I wonder too 
As you know I'm not a brave man 
On the contrary I'm always frightened 
We will find a way 
Perhaps to a better man who does not fail 
Because there is always someone else 
There will be always someone else 
And that's the reason we have to go with you 
How would I get you through the streets 
How will you go 
They're watching me to find you 
But Harry 
Capt Morgan is right 
This is not his fight yet 
You have done enough for us already 
How do you know I won't do it yet 
Good luck 
I hope you find your friend 
Thanks 
Goodbye and thanks 
Then I'll be up in a little while Harry 
Any sign of Eddie 
Your friend's still sitting at his table 
I know 
What's the matter Steve 
I don't know 
What will you do 
We're leaving here for good the three of us 
It'll be rough I'm broke 
Just enough to get us to Port au Prince maybe 
I've never been there 
It could be forever or are you afraid of that 
How long will it take you to pack 
There's a lot of people around here save it 
All set Slim 
Sure but don't make it sad Cricket 
I don't feel that way 
You don't look that way either Let's go 
Top note boys 
Madame de Bursac wants to see you 
She's up in your room 
Why did you 
Please Harry that's all I will ask 
Thanks Harry 
You shouldn't have come it's too risky 
I told you I can't take you 
I didn't come up for that 
I want you to take these 
Suppose they get me before I get out 
Suppose you never come for them 
Please won't you 
Steve Renard just came in he's on his way up 
Did he see you 
I don't think so 
All right 
Good evening may we come in 
Good evening 
No I never carry them 
What's on your mind 
You haven't found them yet 
No 
How would I know that 
I thought perhaps 
Very nice perfume 
You like that 
Yes 
So do I All right Slim come out 
You've met the boys 
Good evening 
Mademoiselle Now we are all here 
So you got him 
Yes 
Now we lack only the two missing persons 
What're you gonna do with him 
You know what that'll do to him 
I think so 
He couldn't stand it he'd crack up 
You could easily prevent that 
Yeah I can 
You got a cigarette 
Can't you make him talk 
When necessary 
You'll find some in that drawer Slim 
How much were you going to give me 
More than what's mine already 
You're probably right 
I haven't got a match 
Don't go any 
All right go on get them up Go on 
Pull your guns go ahead 
Get them out Go ahead and try it 
You're gonna get it anyway 
Don't 
You've been pushing me around long enough 
Slapping girls around That's right go for it 
Your boy needs company 
Look at that ain't that silly 
That's how close you came 
Here you are 
Sit down 
All right come on out 
Take her down get some help 
Okay Steve 
Just how do you think you 
Shut up 
You want to know how I'm gonna get him out 
That broke as easy as you will 
There's a phone in the hall 
Yes you are one of you 
I haven't forgotten you 
You will release him immediately 
Tell him you'll explain later 
I will explain it later 
And now Paul and Madame de Bursac 
They're all yours now 
Thanks Mr Morgan 
They are all ready 
Where will you take them 
Maybe Devil's Island 
What 
Very much Why are you doing this Harry 
I don't know 
I'm glad you are on our side Harry 
You'll have to take care of those guys 
We will give you plenty of time 
Let them it will be a very small fire 
Meet you on the boat 
One minute please 
That's all right let him through 
How are you Harry 
How's everything It's all right now 
Ready Slim 
In a minute Steve 
Close that will you 
Say what is this is she going with us 
Yeah it looks like it 
Harry you mean What's she got 
Who are you 
Was you ever bit by a dead bee 
Was you 
Yeah 
You got to be careful of dead bees 
They can sting you just as bad as live ones 
I feel like I was talking to myself 
I bet I've been bit 100 times that way 
Why don't you bite them back 
I would Only I haven't got a stinger 
I'll have both of you to take care of 
Do I have time to say goodbye to Cricket 
Sure go ahead 
I came to say goodbye 
What 
We're leaving now Thanks for everything 
Hey Slim Are you still happy 
What do you think 
ENGLISH US 
What a quiet place 
Indeed yes very quiet Very quiet 
There's your bathroom Miss 
I see we have the same bathroom 
I think I had better introduce myself 
I'm Vera Claythorne Mrs Owen's secretary 
My name is Emily Brent 
Is there anything you want Miss 
Well I'd like to see Mrs Owen 
No Miss I don't know anything 
Didn't Mrs Owen mention me 
This is a large house What staff have you here 
Just me and Rogers Miss 
Does Mr Owen know we've arrived 
He's not here yet sir 
Where is Mrs Owen 
They were delayed in London sir 
I got a letter They'll be here for dinner 
Eight o'clock sir 
I'm not English 
My name is Prince Nikita Starloff 
Call me Nicky 
How do you do sir I'm Dr Armstrong 
My name is Lombard Philip Lombard 
I'm General Mandrake 
Sir John Mandrake isn't it General 
My wife is dead sir 
I'm afraid I didn't catch your name 
Blore 
Blore 
William Henry Blore 
Oh Philip Lombard 
I'm afraid you've got the wrong bag 
You're very observing Mr Blore 
I like his taste I even borrow his clothes 
It seems we are sharing a bathroom 
Oh I didn't know 
Ah let me help you 
Thank you 
Do you know this part of the English coast 
No I can't say I do 
Something magical about an island 
Yes they're like a world of its own 
How would you like to spend your last days here 
Oh no thanks I think a weekend will be enough 
We all build islands of imagination 
Represents escape 
Well and what's your answer 
Oh I tell them fairytales 
I build them islands of imagined security 
Don't you believe in medicine Doctor 
Do you believe in justice Judge 
Mr Blore 
Yes 
The bathroom's yours 
Do you think they're done 
Done enough for them 
Ethel 
Don't stand there gawking Get 'em up 
Did you wash the floor this morning 
Do you suppose I have time for everything 
I'll talk to Mr Owen when he comes 
You tell him we're quitting 
You knew it was an island Hmph 
With only one house 
Makes me nervous 
Here 
What they don't know won't hurt 'em 
Uh oh Doctor I saw you You drank water 
Water never hurt anyone sir 
Especially in my profession 
Don't forget the old proverb doctor 
Never trust a man who doesn't drink 
Sounds like the Bible Great book 
And now I give you our charming host Mr Owen 
Jolly good fellow 
I don't know 
Oh that accounts for the little Indians 
Indians 
Each little Indian individually 
6 7 8 9 10 
Ten little Indians 
Ten little Indians It's like the nursery rhyme 
Then what happened 
You will find the rhymes on the piano 
Mr Owen seems to be fond of little Indians 
Ten little Indians 
I like my nursery rhymes more in the nursery 
Don't worry judge he's down to the last Indian 
One little Indian boy left all alone 
Silence please Ladies and Gentlemen 
This is your host Mr Owen speaking 
You are charged with the following crimes 
General Sir John Mandrake: 
Judge Francis J Quinncannon: 
Thomas and Ethel Rogers: 
Silence please Ladies and Gentlemen 
This is your host Mr Owen 
What's going on here 
What kind of a practical joke is this 
It's on the record 
An outrageous lie 
I did sir 
Why 
I was just obeying orders sir That's all 
Who's orders 
Mr Owen's 
Now let's get this quite clear 
Mr Owen's orders were what exactly 
I haven't seen Mr Owen I was telling my wife 
I won't touch that money 
Shut up 
May I have Your attention please 
This letter to Rogers is signed by Mr U N Owen 
I must confess I don't know Mr Owen personally 
What kind of a man is he 
Who knows him 
What about yourself Your Highness 
I knew we shouldn't have come here 
Quiet Ethel 
I told you 
Shut up I tell you 
She's quite out of her head Doctor 
10 drops in half a glass of water 
Yes sir 
Oh I hope she'll sleep Doctor 
What's your reason for being here 
Quite frankly I came here professionally 
I'll summarise our findings 
Very peculiar 
I'm here to do a job 
I was hired 
By whom 
This man Owen 
You saw him 
No 
Look here Judge 
U N Owen 
Unknown 
That's a lie 
It's a fantastical idea 
Listen my friends The accusation is true 
Now I remember 
What happened 
They took my licence away 
What about the two people 
I ran over them 
Piggy bad luck 
He may be dangerous 
I quite agree sir 
I can't sir There's no telephone 
The boat only comes twice a week sir 
It won't come again until Monday 
And this is only Friday 
There's no boats here 
No sir 
Why do you want to leave my friends 
Why don't we get to the bottom of this mystery 
It's wonderful Really 
I am all for crime Your Honour 
May I propose a toast: Here is to crime 
How perfectly disgusting Drinks like an animal 
Huh What did you say 
He's not moving 
Just plain drunk 
Just plain dead 
What did the doctor say 
Dead 
What 
What are you looking at Rogers 
It's broken sir 
But Mr Owen isn't the owner sir 
He's only leased it for the weekend 
Ahh then you know more than you told us 
I'd swear to it sir 
I believe you Rogers 
Don't touch 
I thought you'd gone to bed Mr Blore 
Perhaps it the same in yours 
Why don't you want me To touch that glass 
Smell it 
Lethal solution 
Suicide 
Doctor 
Doctor Armstrong Doctor Armstrong 
What is it Rogers 
Go ahead I'll follow you 
Good morning Miss Brent 
I hope you slept better than I did 
Good morning General 
Good morning 
General Mandrake 
Yes Juliet Oh 
Forgive me young lady 
I was thinking of my wife 
Do you mind if I sit down like this 
Morning Judge Morning Miss Brent 
What 
Is something worrying you 
I don't understand it 
These little figures 
How many were there last night 
Ten Yes ten 
And now how many do you see 
Eight 
Only eight 
That's what I counted 
What about breakfast 
I'm afraid you'll have to go without breakfast 
Mrs Rogers died in her sleep 
What 
What 
How 
Heart failure 
Her heart certainly failed to beat 
What caused it to fail I cannot say 
Conscience 
Oh conscience my eye What about her husband 
It's all right Rogers We understand 
But I thought you told us he was dead 
His wife Eh 
His wife 
Wife 
No matter how guilty she was 
The wicked flee when no man pursueth 
Nor I What do you say Judge 
How does the rhyme go Miss Claythorne 
Ten Little Indians 
One choked his little self and then were nine 
Go on 
We are eight people on this island now 
Lombard 
I'll be ready in a minute 
Take your time 
You know I got it 
Got what 
There's one thing this fellow Owen forgot 
This island is just a bare rock 
We'll catch that raving maniac 
You mean Rogers is lying 
Why not 
That's why I think that he is telling the truth 
It doesn't matter if Rogers is lying or not 
You mean you haven't any weapon 
Mr Owen is hiding maybe inside this house 
He appears to have an accomplice haven't he 
If you ask me Rogers 
I have a feeling I being watched Secretly 
What do you see 
I I thought heard a strange voice 
That's what I think sir 
Me too 
We've all come to the same opinion 
We must find his place of concealment 
Do you hear that 
Hello puss Looking for a mouse So are we 
I wonder where the old boy is 
Nothing in there but the Russian 
Ten Little Indians 
Yes 
It certainly was his swan song 
One thing is certain He isn't inside 
Therefore he must be outside 
Brilliant thinking Blore 
No boat will ever come Juliet 
Sir John 
Oh Forgive me my child You don't understand 
Nobody 
Not a living thing 
Not even a hiding place 
Not even a seagull could hide down there 
I don't understand it 
Maybe we've been wrong 
Building a nightmare out of imagination 
Two people dead isn't imagination 
The Russian may have committed suicide 
And Mrs Rogers 
We cannot blunder as detectives sometimes do 
Let's face it: we're in a trap 
That's right Mr Owen's hand is plain to see 
Yes but where the devil is Mr Owen himself 
Okay Rogers 
Oh we understand 
Rogers we're only seven today 
I'm sorry miss 
You called General Mandrake 
I looked in his room Miss but he's not there 
Didn't he come in the house 
I didn't see him Doctor 
He seemed quite abnormal 
I know where he is 
You stay here Miss Claythorne 
You say the General was behaving very strangely 
Like a man out of his mind 
In other words a lunatic 
Right ho the old boy's barmy 
Whom the Gods destroy they first make mad 
Well Aren't we looking for a lunatic 
He said no boat would ever come 
Doctor you better come with me 
Don't wait for us 
And don't wait for the General any longer 
Poisoned glass could mean suicide 
Or an act of God 
That is why he has enticed us to this island 
Doctor Doctor Armstrong 
What is it man 
There's another Indian figure missing 
That accounts for the General 
I was expecting that 
How can he be here 
I don't believe in the invisible man 
He's not invisible 
Perfectly clear 
Mr Owen is one of us 
Do you have to do that 
I'm just studying Mr Owen's little scheme 
Maybe you know how the General was killed 
My dear Blore can't you read 
The old soldier stayed here didn't he 
Am I disturbing your little game 
Not at all Blore 
What game are you playing judge 
There we are Eight of us came to this island 
The Rogers were waiting for us 
Don't forget waiting for us 
One of the ten is Mr Owen 
We agree on that 
Who 
The dead ones 
Our Russian friend Mrs Rogers and the General 
Six One is bogus 
Correct sir One of us is Mr Owen 
Which one 
Where's your alibi 
I'm not like you Mr Blore 
I am a well known professional man 
My dear doctor that proves less than nothing 
I too am a well known person 
But doctors have gone mad before now 
Judges have gone mad and so have policemen 
And may I say explorers Mr Lombard 
You may You may 
Why do you leave Miss Claythorne out of it 
We don't 
Nor you my dear lady 
What about Rogers 
That's what I was thinking 
What do we know about him 
He put that record on the gramophone didn't he 
That's a fact 
Oh no no no Bad psychology 
You can rule Rogers out definitely 
I don't see why 
Look at the shape of his head 
He hasn't the brains for it 
We must suspect each and everyone among us 
Now I warn everybody to be on his guard 
Go on playing 
Thank you 
Aren't you going to return the compliment 
I haven't made up my mind about you Mr Lombard 
Whom do you suspect 
The one nearest the fire 
I think you're wrong 
Well who then 
A man who believes in punishing crime 
After having been a judge 
Rogers I'd like to ask you a few questions 
Did you 
prepare a nice dinner 
Just cold meat sir 
I see I'm sure you do your best I do 
Is there plenty of food for the weekend 
Oh yes sir Everything was provided for 
Oh Mr Blore may I ask you a question 
Of course of course my dear fellow 
How many will you be for dinner tonight 
But Oh I see what you mean 
Don't forget your vote Rogers 
No no no Never touch it No 
Now whom do we suspect of being Mr Owen 
Mr Lombard one vote 
Mr Blore one vote 
Dr Armstrong one vote 
Rogers one vote 
Miss Brent one vote 
I see I haven't been neglected One vote 
Another vote for you Rogers You win 
You mean sir that I am being accused 
You said I didn't have the brains to do it 
I didn't vote for you Rogers 
Well who did then 
Who didn't drink the cocktail you just served 
You think I poisoned those cocktails 
I'll show you sir 
Picking on an innocent man 
I can't touch even a drop of alcohol 
Oh Rogers come back here 
You can't do that 
Don't look so offended Rogers 
If it had been anybody but you sir 
I didn't Your Honour I voted for well 
Time will tell 
What about that gramophone record 
What about it 
Let's not stand on our dignity Rogers 
After all she was sick 
Didn't you shorten her suffering in this world 
No thank you 
Pardon me 
I'm going to retire Good night 
If you don't mind I'll say good night too 
Not so fast Mr Lombard I'll go with you 
The more the merrier 
And safer 
Warm in here isn't it 
Yes quite warm quite warm 
And lonely 
Yes quite lonely quite quite lonely 
Rogers 
Yes sir 
Anything you wish sir 
Don't put any water in it 
I shan't sir 
Don't forget to lock your door 
You cannot lock out the devil 
I think there's another one who's barmy 
I don't fancy you will Blore 
No It takes a lot to send me off my head 
I feel quite sane at the moment 
Thank you 
Have you told him 
Yes sir 
I know the jury's decision 
Well then I shall sleep in the woodshed 
And now if you'll excuse me Good night 
I'll lock it behind him 
That's not enough Mr Blore 
Still seven Lock that door please 
Put the key there 
We'll have no more Indian tricks tonight 
Lock it Mr Blore 
No wait Now no one can get in there but you 
Oh I see But who's going to keep it 
Rogers Open up Rogers 
Keep away from that door 
It's me Lombard Open up 
Do you take me for a fool Mr Lombard 
Don't be silly Rogers 
Don't be silly yourself sir 
This is Judge Quinncannon 
You know my voice Rogers 
Doctor Armstrong 
Open the door 
We just want to give you a key 
What for 
Never mind you idiot 
Hurry up It's raining 
Shove it under the door sir 
Good night Rogers Keep your door locked 
Don't worry about me sir 
Ohhh be careful Judge 
Oh I shall 
Never mind 
I need hardly advise you to lock you doors 
And put a chair under the handle 
Good night 
Good night 
May we all meet safely in the morning 
Good night 
Good night sir 
Miss Brent 
Miss Brent She doesn't answer 
Is her door locked 
She's not here 
You grasp the fact very quickly Blore 
What's wrong Mr Blore 
Miss Brent's missing 
What's wrong with that It's late 
We must have all overslept I heard her get up 
I locked that door last night 
Who opened it 
Good morning It's such a pretty pattern 
I thought I'd like to copy it for a new shawl 
Was that door locked when you went out 
Yes I opened it 
Good morning Miss Brent 
I feel perfectly safe when I'm alone 
Poor man I hope he didn't catch cold 
What's that 
Someone's knocking 
Kitchen door 
Rogers of course 
He wants to get in That's it 
Where is he 
Rogers 
Rogers 
He's not there 
Rogers 
Know what I think We got our man 
It's Rogers It fits the psychological pattern 
Psychological pattern my eye 
I go by facts He was officially accused Fact 
He got drunk 
He wouldn't open the door to the woodshed 
Fact 
He disappears 
He's dead 
The murderer was fastidious 
Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks; 
We were all in our rooms except 
No breakfast yet 
No If I had a butler like Rogers 
I'd soon get rid of him 
Wait 
We we've forgotten something 
What 
It's still locked 
Where's the key We found it in Rogers's pocket 
One Two Three 
Five Six Another one missing 
But the door was locked 
I get it 
No I don't 
Did you ever hear of a bee sting being fatal 
No why 
Six little Indian boys playing with a hive; 
A bumblebee stung one and then there were five 
Watch out for a bee 
I'd be careful with that young man 
I mean to Miss Brent I'm careful of everyone 
A clear conscience is the best armour 
The innocent has to be surrounded by criminals 
That sounds like Mr Owen talking 
What about his accusations against you 
I wonder if these eggs are fresh 
What about it Miss Brent 
From the father's side of course 
But he was no good naturally 
I had to have him placed in a reformatory 
I do hope these eggs aren't overcooked 
What happened to the boy 
I got it I know who took the last Indian 
Who 
He had the key to this room 
Fact 
he chops some sticks Fact 
And then 
And then 
True Miss Brent 
Perfectly true 
The murderer meets Rogers outside and kills him 
Yes but the key was still in Rogers' pocket 
Of course 
Or goes for an innocent walk before breakfast 
Sorry Miss Brent 
Anyone have more tea 
Lombard 
Lombard 
Yes Blore 
What you doing here 
You called me didn't you Yes Oh yes yes 
Describing every move 
Why is that Lack of imagination 
No man ever got the better of me yet 
Yes yes one should never trust a woman 
She's clearly manic depressive 
I don't know why I didn't see it before 
She left no clue 
What about this eh 
She tried to throw us off the track 
It's her I'll stake my life it's her 
Wait Blore 
Let Miss Claythorne call her 
She'll be less suspicious 
Miss Brent 
Miss Brent 
Miss Brent Miss Brent 
It's no use Miss Claythorne 
Look at the bee 
Nothing but a small mark on the neck 
Here's your bee Doctor 
Somebody must have taken it It's not here 
See for yourself 
What poison was injected 
But the bee That bee in her room 
That's our murderer's artistic touch 
He likes to stick to his blasted nursery jingle 
He's mad 
The rest of us are defenceless 
How do we know one of us hasn't have a revolver 
A good point Blore 
How about you Doctor 
Miss Claythorne 
Why didn't you tell us that you had a revolver 
I've got him 
Aren't you wasting your time 
I know where it is 
It's not here 
Look again Blore 
Look in his pockets 
Don't Get him off 
Get him off 
It's not here What did you do with it 
What did you do with it 
Good heavens where is it 
At a time like this 
A game of the mind Blore a game of the mind 
Why not 
When a third person is present nothing happens 
But we're not alone 
Blore 
Look another misfortune 
Something wrong with the machinery 
Batteries must be running down 
I'll go to the woodshed and see to it 
Leave it on Doctor leave it on 
You went away from the window and left me alone 
I shall 
Where's Miss Claythorne 
I don't know 
Woodshed 
What's wrong Doctor 
Lombard 
Come here Lombard 
Where's Vera 
Answer me 
Don't come any closer 
Where is she 
If you make another move I'll brain you 
You know Doctor please give me a chance 
If you are Mr Owen friend attend 
I won't say a word to the others 
Don't torment me this way 
I won't say a word 
I'll even help you if you spare my life 
Look I trust you Don't you trust me 
Um yes 
That's more reasonable 
Don't come any closer 
Isn't your arm getting tired 
Hang on someone's coming 
I'm looking for oh 
He's right Vera You shouldn't be so careless 
Come on Stay here both of you 
Now I can do what I came out to do 
Do not know anything about electricity 
Don't bother me 
Stay where you are 
Do you think it will 
Why not 
This is no accident 
Someone wants this house to be dark at night 
Who The one we fear 
My dear Doctor we've made a mistake 
Now we can trust each other 
But now we can form an alliance you and I 
And find the murderer 
Just what I was thinking 
Oh ho I needed that 
Now 
Now we can tell each other the truth 
The entire truth 
Who's going to speak first 
Very well I shall begin 
It's perfectly true 
He was an innocent man on trial for his life 
I'd nothing against him 
The gramophone record did not lie 
Guilty I was but of drinking not of killing 
I don't see where this is getting us 
Sit down Mr Blore 
Isn't that right Doctor 
If I were you I would speak Mr Blore 
I didn't kill anybody 
We're listening Mr Blore 
On my testimony he got sent up for life 
That's all 
But he died in prison didn't he 
Course he did 
How could I know that would happen 
Don't get excited Blore 
Mr Lombard is unable to deny a thing 
Are you leaving us Miss Claythorne 
My dear child you're trembling 
I I'm so cold 
No We wait while you get your coat 
Thank you 
Stay here Mr Lombard 
Get a light 
Haven't got one 
Who is it It's me Blore 
Guy Lombard 
How do I know in the dark 
Where have you been all this time 
I went to my room to get this candle 
Where have you been 
I've been looking for my flashlight 
Blore What the devil are you doing in my room 
Your room 
No wonder I couldn't find anything 
Did you hear anything 
It's Vera's 
Vera 
Vera What happened Don't be frightened Vera 
He was in my room 
Who was it 
I don't know My candles went out 
We'll soon find out 
Hey Lights Lights 
Seaweed 
It felt like a cold hand 
That's what Miss Claythorne walked into 
Who brought it in here 
Who brought it into the house 
Miss Brent 
Are you sure Miss Brent is 
Dead as a doornail 
Where's the judge 
That's funny I thought he came up with us 
Shot What did I tell you 
What 
You say you heard a shot 
Yes 
There's one way to find out 
It's my own 
No It looks too easy 
Alright Judge come outside 
Don't think I can't see you 
He has been shot through the head 
Only one shot fired 
Who will be next 
Another one proved innocent too late 
Silenced by who 
By whom 
Don't you remember 
True 
Yes 
You opened that door; 
What made you run the wrong way 
Agreed 
Now wait a minute Don't confuse things 
Now you wait a minute Mr Lombard 
How do we know what was in the judge's mind 
I'd rather not talk about it 
Ah but you must 
We've all confessed our little errors 
All except you Come now my girl 
Will you take my word if I tell you I didn't 
I'm afraid I will 
Then you have my word for it 
And don't ask me any more questions 
Can't you see she's telling the truth 
That is precisely her mistake 
I don't see why 
You will You will 
The judge reasoned it out 
Right 
We three have admitted shall I say our guilt 
Right 
Right 
I get it What a wonderful brain 
To think he couldn't save his own life 
Yes but he saved ours 
Yes of course that's the important thing 
Do you understand now Mr Lombard 
Oh wait a minute 
Oh no Not you either Blore 
Now nobody has it 
That's an excellent arrangement 
Now we can all sleep 
Let's turn in gentlemen 
Good night gentlemen 
Doctor I find one flaw in your theory 
Suppose I say: I am Mr Owen 
Too bad I was just trying to be helpful 
Good night 
Sleep well I hope I will 
I'm sure I will 
How long have you been out there 
Shh Not so loud 
How long have you been out there 
Ever since you put out your light 
I wanted to be here to welcome Mr Owen 
How do I know he's not here already 
What about me 
Hmm You're not smart enough 
Yes he did 
Or maybe he was never killed 
Yes he was 
By someone who was close to you 
And you were suspected 
It was my sister 
I took care of her to the very last 
Oh now I see that Mr Owen isn't infallible 
You don't belong in this house 
You haven't killed your way into it 
Don't call me Mister And don't call me Lombard 
I'll tell you something about Mr Lombard 
Something else that Mr Owen doesn't know 
Listen 
Give me a chance to grab him when he comes in 
Don't shoot unless you have to 
He's going away 
Down the stairs 
I'm going to find out 
I forgot It's locked 
I'll go around the other way 
He might kill you 
The one who's not in his room 
Blore 
Blore Get up Open the door 
Who let that girl out of her room 
Never mind about her Come on Blore 
He's not here Now we know who it is 
How do I know you heard the doctor 
Don't be a fool Blore 
We've no time to waste 
Ah life is short isn't it 
But I heard him too Mr Blore 
Oh you did did you 
A nice present you've got there 
Mr Lombard's getting generous 
You go first 
Come on Vera 
Might be a trick 
Right Blore Maybe he's in the house 
One Two Three 
He wants to make us think he's dead 
That's to throw us off the track 
You don't fool us this time Dr Armstrong 
Who's there 
Lombard 
Blore What are you doing down there alone 
I think I know where the doctor is 
Where 
I'm not sure yet I'll wait for you 
Alright We shan't be long 
I get it 
But I thought it was you 
You heard it too eh 
I heard you pass my door 
Not me I thought I heard you 
I wanted to ask you the same thing 
No no no I knocked on his door 
I heard a noise while I was dressing 
Like a door slamming 
Exactly 
You heard it too huh 
What is it 
Oh I don't know 
Yes I know what you mean 
Oh it's just nerves 
Then you have felt it 
Keep a grip on yourself darling 
It's definitely human 
You mean it's the doctor 
The mad doctor 
Hiding here 
We'll soon find out 
He must have been looking that way 
And while he was looking Dr Armstrong 
That was Armstrong we both heard 
What do you see 
What is it 
It's impossible 
Let me see 
You're going to see Come with me 
What is it 
What is it Tell me 
Look 
Armstrong He's been dead for hours 
For hours 
Since the last tide 
No footprints around the body 
But if he was Who killed Blore 
You 
And you 
So this is how it ends Vera 
This is how it ends We come to the truth now 
Yes the truth The entire truth 
Don't come any closer 
Oh I see That's not quite right my dear 
It doesn't fit in your nursery rhyme 
Don't try to talk your way out 
You made one mistake giving me this revolver 
Look I don't mind being killed 
Didn't I tell you I wasn't Lombard 
What is your name 
Charles Morley 
You're not a very good detective 
Why did you come here under another name 
I knew Lombard very well He committed suicide 
Do you expect me to believe this 
Why not 
That one of us is Mr Owen 
Don't try to fool me I know I'm not 
If you're so sure go ahead and shoot me 
You see 
You have a doubt 
Don't come any closer I'll shoot 
There's got to be an explanation 
Yes that's it You've got to shoot me 
Now shoot 
But it won't hit you 
A game of the mind Miss Claythorne 
You came just in time for my last shot 
And now the game is over 
What if I don't agree to hang myself 
Oh that's been taken care of 
You mind if I sit down 
Every artist has a certain amount of vanity 
We all like the approbation of the public 
And you are my last public 
I had two great ideas 
And you've seen the result 
It was simply this: 
I must appear to be the next victim 
Remember the seaweed 
Armstrong and I placed it in your room 
Your scream was perfect 
Now I was assumed to be dead 
And which he found later on the steps 
I counted on everyone's confusion in the dark 
He has been shot through the head 
After that I had to play my part 
And what a part it was 
Justice had triumphed once again 
Ten 
My dear child I'm an old and sick man 
I received my death sentence a year ago 
Rather than go painfully and slowly 
But how can you force me to hang myself 
As the last little Indian has to be 
Public hanging isn't pretty 
It's more dignified 
And now my work is done 
Never should trust a woman 
Thanks for the advice Mr Owen 
By the way why did you trust me 
Why did you 
Somebody Somebody's still alive 
Good morning 
Ready to leave now Ho ho are we 
Are the others ready too 
You call them 
Evening Mr Godby 
Hello Hello Hello 
Quite a stranger aren't you 
I couldn't get in yesterday 
I wondered what had happened to you 
I had a bit of a dust up 
What about 
Fat lot of good he'd be 
He ticked him off 
Seeing's believing 
He ticked him off proper 
Changed his tune Paid up like lightening 
Exactly he couldn't handle it himself 
He had to call the police 
He's not a bad lot Saunders 
Indeed 
A chap I know is getting married 
Very interesting I'm sure 
What's up with you 
I dont know what you mean 
You're a bit unfriendly 
Beryl hurry up 
Put some more coal in the stove 
Yes Mrs Bagot

Time and tide wait for no man 
What a lovely surprise 
Oh Dolly

Get me my cup of tea would you 
I can't drag my bones to the counter 
No please 
What a nice looking man 
Who is he You're a dark horse 
I meant to pop in but Tony had measles 
Then I'd that fuss over Phyllis You don't know 
She left me 
I never really liked her but Tony adored her 
I'll tell you later in the train Thank you 
Oh dear 
No sugar 
It's in the spoon 
Of course What a fool I am 
I loathe shopping by myself 
There's your train 
Yes I know 
Aren't you coming with us 
No I go in the opposite direction 
My practice is in Churley 
I see 
I'm a general practitioner 
Dr Harvey's going to Africa next week 
How thrilling 
I must go 
Yes you must 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
The other day I'd been to see Bob's solicitor 
I could've got it here in Milford 
It was enormous 
When I got home it was battered to bits 
Is that our train 
Is that the Ketchworth train 
No it's the express 
The boat train 
That doesn't stop does it 
I want some chocolate please 
Milk or plain 
Plain I think 
Nestle's nut milk 
One plain and one nut milk 
Large or small 
Large please 
Where is she 
I never noticed her go 
I couldn't think where you'd disappeared to 
I wanted to see the express go through 
What's the matter 
Are you feeling ill 
I feel a little sick 
Come and sit down 
There's our train 
Have you any brandy 
It's out of hours 
Surely if somebody's ill 
I'm all right 
Brandy will buck you up Please 
Very well 
How much 
Tenpence please 
We have to hurry 
This is a bit of luck 
This train is generally packed 
I'm all right I just felt faint 
He certainly was good looking 
Who 
Your friend Dr Whats his name 
Yes he's a nice creature 
Have you known him long 
No not very long 
I hardly know him at all 
My dear 
I've always loved doctors 
I wish I could trust you 
I wish 
I wish 
Fancy him going to Africa Is he married 
Yes 
Any children 
Yes 2 boys He's very proud of them 
Is he taking them with him 
Wife and children 
Yes he is 
One has one's roots hasn't one 
Yes one has one's roots 
I knew a girl who went to Africa 
I wish you'd stop talking 
But I wish you'd stop talking 
Provincial and very nouveau riche 
Oh Dolly 
Are you feeling ill again 
A bit dizzy 
I'll close my eyes for a bit 
Poor darling 
Here am I chatting away 
I won't say another word 
You can powder your nose before we get out 
Thanks Dolly 
This can't last 
This misery can't last 
I must remember that and try to control myself 
Not even life lasts very long 
I don't want that time to come ever 
Wake up Laura We're here 
I could take you home It isn't out of my way 
You're quite sure 
Positive Thank you 
I shall disappoint you Good night 
Is that you Laura 
Yes dear 
Thank goodness you're back 
The place has been in an uproar 
What's the matter 
Bobbie and Margaret fighting again 
They won't go to sleep until you talk to them 
Mummy 
Is that you Mummy 
Yes Margaret 
Come upstairs at once Mummy 
I want to talk to you 
You're both very naughty You should be asleep 
Now what is it 
It's too late to discuss it 
Oh Mummy 
Why not take them to both 
One in the afternoon and one in the evening 
One on one day the other on the other 
You accuse me of spoiling the children 
All right have it your own way 
Circus or Pantomime 
Neither 
Oh Fred 
What on earth's the matter 
Nothing It's nothing 
Darling what's wrong 
Tell me please 
Really it's nothing 
I'm run down that's all 
Isn't it idiotic 
But she meant to be kind 
Isn't it awful about people meaning to be kind 
Would you like to go to bed 
No Fred really 
Come and sit by the fire and relax 
You can help me with the crossword 
You have the most peculiar ideas of relaxation 
There you are darling 
Thank you 
But why a fainting spell 
I can't understand it 
Don't be silly I've often had fainting spells 
That was a nose bleed 
There'd be no harm in you seeing Dr Graves 
It would be a waste of time 
Now listen 
shut up Don't make a fuss 
Nothing more than that 
All right 
Really nothing 
Get on with your puzzle and leave me in peace 
Have it your own way 
Romance I think I'm almost sure 
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance 
It'll be in the Oxford 
No it's right It fits in 
Would music put you off 
No dear I'd like it 
Fred 
Fred dear Fred 
There's so much I want to say 
Never never 
I don't want you to be hurt 
This is my home 
I've been so foolish 
I've fallen in love 
I'm an ordinary woman 
The Refreshment Room at Milford Junction 
My train wasn't due for ten minutes 
Any sugar 
In the spoon 
He passed by my table on the way to his 
The woman was going on as usual 
Minnie hasn't touched her milk 
Did you put it down for her 
Yes but she never came for it 
Fond of animals 
In their place 
My landlady's mad for animals 
I don't know what breed you mean 
I don't think it knows itself 
And my other cup 
I have to go 
The 5:40 will be here in a minute 
Who's on the gate 
Young William 
Would you like me to have a look 
Don't trouble The water will do 
Bit of coal dust I expect 
Nasty very nasty 
Better 
I'm afraid not 
Oh Can I help you 
No Just something in my eye 
Pull your eyelid down 
And then blow your nose 
Please let me look I happen to be a doctor 
It's very kind of you 
Turn round to the light please 
Now look up now look down 
Keep still I see it 
There 
What a relief It was agonising 
It looks like a bit of grit 
It was when the express went through 
Thank you very much indeed 
There we go I must run 
Lucky for me you were here 
Anybody could have done it 
Never mind you did I'm grateful 
That's my train I must go Goodbye 
Goodbye 
That's how it all began 
Just through me getting a bit of grit in my eye 
At least I didn't think it did 
The next Thursday I went into Milford as usual 
I changed my book at Boots 
I like the smell of a chemist's 
Fortunately she didn't look up 
I got out without her buttonholing me 
Just as I stepped onto the pavement 
Good morning 
Oh good morning 
How's the eye 
Perfectly all right 
How kind it was of you 
It was nothing at all 
It's clearing up I think 
Yes it's going to be nice 
Well I must get to the hospital 
And I must get to the grocer's 
What exciting lives we lead 
Goodbye 
That evening I had to run to the station 
I was thinking of other things 
The next Thursday 
Yes I'll have it 
Thank you Madam 
The sun was out 
Everyone looked more cheerful than usual 
A bit of luck wasn't it 
Or was it 
so I smiled and said/ Good morning 
Good morning Are you all alone 
Yes I am 
Could I share your table 
It's very full and there's nowhere else 
Of course not 
I'm afraid we haven't been introduced properly 
My name's Alec Harvey 
How do you do 
Mine's Laura Jesson 
Mrs Or Miss 
Mrs You're a doctor aren't you 
You said so in the Refreshment Room 
Yes sir 
What did you plump for 
The soup and fried sole 
Yes I'll have the same 
Anything to drink 
No thank you 
Would you like anything to drink 
No just plain water please 
Plain water please 
Do look at the cellist 
It really is dreadful isn't it 
But we oughtn't laugh They might see 
You don't play the piano I hope 
I was forced to as a child 
You haven't kept it up 
No my husband isn't musical at all 
Good for him 
Oh dear no 
Why are you so sure 
You're too sane and uncomplicated 
You could never be dull 
Do you come here every Thursday 
Yes I spend the day at the hospital 
and I study the hospital patients 
I see 
Do you 
Do I what 
Come here every Thursday 
Yes I do the week's shopping 
Are you going to the pictures this afternoon 
Yes 
How extraordinary 
so am I 
How can you be so silly 
I got through most of my work this morning 
Well I 
I'll sit downstairs and you upstairs 
Upstairs is too expensive 
It all seemed so natural and innocent 
I really must insist 
I couldn't possibly 
I shall give in gracefully 
We halved it meticulously 
We even halved the tip 
Thank you 
We have two choices 
Love in a Mist at the Palladium 
You're very knowledgeable 
I insist 
I hoped you were going to treat me 
Which is it to be: 
Palace or Palladium 
It was a famous victory 
Do you feel guilty at all 
I do 
Guilty 
I worked this morning 
A little relaxation never harmed anyone 
Why should we feel guilty 
I don't know 
How awfully nice you are 
It can't be 
It is 
We walked to the station together 
I didn't notice it then but I remember it now 
What's she like your wife 
Small dark rather delicate 
How funny I thought she would've been fair 
And your husband what's he like 
You said that proudly 
Did I 
Good evening 
Evening 
Two teas please 
Cake or pastry 
Cake or pastry 
No thank you 
Are those Bath buns fresh 
Certainly Made this morning 
Two please 
That'll be sevenpence 
Take the tea to the table Beryl 
I'll carry the buns 
You must eat one of these 
Very fattening 
I don't hold with such foolishness 
They do look good I must say 
One of my earliest passions in life 
What happened then Mrs Bagot 
Well 
Didn't you never go back 
And what happened to him 
Dad as a doornail in three years 
Well I never 
Is tea bad for one 
Worse than coffee 
Why did you become a doctor 
That's a long story 
Perhaps because I'm an idealist 
All doctors should have ideals 
or their work would be unbearable 
Don't encourage me to talk shop 
Why not 
It's what interests you 
Yes it is 
I'm terribly ambitious really 
Not for myself for my special pigeon 
What's your special pigeon 
Preventative medicine 
I see 
I'm afraid you don't 
I was trying to be intelligent 
Most good doctors have private dreams 
It's the best part of them 
A deep rooted desire to do good 
Yes I see that 
That's where my ideal comes in 
My speciality is pneumoconiosis 
Oh dear 
Don't be alarmed It's simpler than it sounds 
You suddenly look much younger 
Do I 
Almost like a little boy 
What made you say that 
I don't know 
Yes I do 
Tell me 
Yes the inhalation of coal dust 
What are the others 
Steel works 
Yes of course steel works 
And silicosis 
That's stone dust Gold mines 
I see 
There's your train 
Yes 
You mustn't miss it 
No 
What's the matter 
Nothing Nothing at all really 
I feel stupid not to understand more 
Shall I see you again 
You have to run 
Mine's not due for a few minutes 
Shall I see you again 
Yes of course 
Please please 
What is it 
Next Thursday the same time 
No I couldn't possibly 
Please 
I ask you most humbly 
You'll miss your train 
All right 
Run 
Goodbye 
I'll be there 
Thank you 
Or perhaps upstairs not feeling very well 
small dark and rather delicate 
I wondered if he'd say/ 
We had lunch and went to the pictures 
As if they could read my thoughts 
No one was except a clergyman 
Good evening Mrs Jesson 
It was silly flirting with a stranger 
Good evening 
I walked home briskly and cheerfully 
You met me in the hall 
It's all right keep calm and don't get upset 
What's wrong 
Bobbie's been knocked down 
The doctor's with him now 
It's all right Don't worry 
He'll be as right as rain in a few hours 
You're sure it's not serious 
Quite sure It was a lucky escape 
I've given him a sedative 
Keep him at home a couple of days 
It must have been a shock 
Oh good 
He's much too young to decide 
Good life He's a feeling for it 
How can we know 
He'll want to be an engine driver next week 
No that was last week 
It's so final entering a child for the Navy 
It's a healthy life 
I know it's a good healthy life 
What do you mean 
We'll hardly see him 
Nonsense 
It isn't nonsense 
You've rather a Victorian view of the Navy 
You are annoying 
You know I'd hate that 
All right have it your own way 
Fred 
Good for you 
He's awfully nice He's a doctor 
A very noble profession 
Dear 
Yes 
I wish he hadn't 
It spoils everything 
We could ask him to dinner 
By all means 
Who 
Doctor Harvey The one I was telling you about 
Must it be dinner 
You're never at home for lunch 
Exactly 
Oh Fred 
Now what on earth's the matter 
Nothing It's only 
Oh Fred 
I really don't see what's so funny 
I'm the funny one I'm an absolute idiot 
I told you it was nothing serious 
Nothing to get in a state about 
I see that now I really do 
It didn't seem important but I had promised 
I managed to get the same table 
I waited a bit but he didn't come 
The orchestra was playing as usual 
Today she didn't seem funny 
She looked pathetic 
After lunch I passed the hospital 
It was a noisy musical and I'm so sick of them 
I'd come out before the end 
As I took my tea to the table 
Albert Godby how dare you 
I couldn't resist 
Keep your hands to yourself 
An avenging angel 
I'll give you avenging angel 
Coming here taking liberties 
I thought after last Monday you wouldn't mind 
Never mind last Monday I'm on duty now 
You ought to be ashamed 
It's high spirits Don't be mad 
Indeed 
Take your tea and be quiet 
It's all your fault really 
I don't know what you mean 
I was thinking of tonight 
Give us a kiss 
I'll do no such thing 
Come on a quick one across the bar 
Albert stop it 
Come on 
Let go 
Come on love 
Albert 
Just in time or born in the vestry 
Come on what are you gaping at 
His train 
He wasn't on the platform 
I'm so terribly sorry I couldn't let you know 
Your train you'll miss it 
The house surgeon had to operate 
Don't say any more 
Quickly 
Quickly 
The whistle's gone 
How absurd 
Quickly 
Quickly 
Next Thursday 
Yes Next Thursday 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Thursday 
Goodbye 
It was a terribly bad picture 
The usherette looked at us with stoney contempt 
We decided to go to the botanical gardens 
Not so withdrawn and shy and difficult 
Fred it was a lovely afternoon 
He thought we were raving mad 
Perhaps he was right 
Alec rowed and I trailed my hand in the water 
It was cold but a lovely feeling 
You don't row very well do you 
We had such fun 
I felt gay and happy and released 
That's what's so shameful 
Look out 
We can't get through 
Pull on your left 
I never could tell left from right 
I'm most awfully sorry 
The British are always nice to mad people 
Tea milk even sugar 
Thank you 
You know what's happened don't you 
Yes 
Yes I do 
I've fallen in love with you 
Yes I know 
What do you believe 
That it's the same for you 
That you've fallen in love too 
It sounds so silly 
Why 
I know you so little 
It is true though isn't it 
It's true 
No please We must be sensible 
We mustn't behave like this 
We must forget what we've said 
Not yet 
But we must 
Listen 
It's too late to be sensible 
Too late to forget what we said 
Whether we said it or not doesn't matter 
We know We've known for a long time 
How can you say that 
I've only known you 4 weeks 
Last Thursday week 
Has it been a long time since then 
Answer me truly 
Yes 
Several times a day 
So did I 
Oh Alec 
I love you 
the way you laugh at my jokes 
Please don't 
I love you 
I love you 
Yes it has 
I don't want to pretend to you or anyone 
But from now I have to 
That's what's wrong you see 
It spoils everything 
There's still time 
There's no time at all 
There's your train 
I'll come to the platform with you 
No Alec not here someone will see 
I love you so 
Could we turn that down a bit darling 
Laura 
Yes dear 
You were miles away 
Was I 
Why not turn it down 
It really is deafening 
Of course 
I shan't be long Then we'll go to bed 
You look a bit tired 
Don't hurry I'm perfectly happy 
If only it were true 
Taking him away into the darkness 
I was happy then 
He said he loved me and I said I loved him 
Alec and me 
And with nothing in the way 
I saw us in Paris in a box at the opera 
The orchestra was tuning up 
All the silly dreams disappeared 
You won't but I do 
That was the first time I'd ever lied to you 
Good evening Mrs Jesson 
Hello dear 
Had a good day 
Yes lovely 
What did you do 
All by yourself 
Yes 
No not exactly 
What do you mean not exactly 
I walked her to the bus and came home on my own 
Very well A little fatter 
You go down I won't be five minutes 
Ketchworth 37 please 
Hello Is Mrs Norton there please 
Yes I'll hold on 
Hello 
Hello is that you Mary 
Laura 
Fancy hearing from you I thought you were dead 
No I haven't seen you for ages 
As bad as all that 
My life depends on it 
Go on 
This is were the black lie comes in 
But darling of course not 
I'll do as much for you I promise 
Well let's really lunch one day 
Yes that'd be lovely 
What about next Thursday 
No I can't That's my Milford day 
What about Friday 
Fine better make it here 
All right perfect 
You know what my cook's like 
It'll have to be early 
Yes all right 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
That week was misery 
I was in a sort of trance 
Thursday came at last 
Hello 
Hello 
I didn't mean to really but here I am 
It all seemed very grand 
Laura 
It was you after all 
Hermione said it was 
I never saw you at all How awful 
I expect it was the champagne 
I'm not used to champagne for lunch or dinner 
but Alec insisted 
Alec who dear 
No I don't think 
He'll be back 
You'll recognise him when you peer closely 
He looks charming very attentive 
He's a dear 
Alec do you remember Mrs Norton 
I'm afraid I don't 
Alec this is Mrs Rolandson 
How do you do 
Yes 
Goodbye Doctor Harvey 
Goodbye 
Goodbye my dear I do envy you your champagne 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
That was awful 
Never mind 
They'd watched us all through lunch 
Forget it Come out and look at the surprise 
There was a bridge and a stream 
I shivered and Alec put his asm around me 
Cold 
No not really 
Happy 
No not really 
I know exactly what you're going to say 
Isn't that it 
Something like that 
What 
It is true for you isn't it 
It's true 
I felt as if I was on the edge of a precipice 
I think Alec felt that too 
I refused rather too vehemently 
I'm going back I'm going to miss my train 
Back where 
To stephen's flat 
Oh Alec 
I must go home I really must go 
A cup of tea please 
Good afternoon 
Afternoon lady 
Couple of whiskies please 
Very sorry It's out of hours 
Sneak us a couple under them old sandwiches 
Come on be a sport 
My throat's like a parrot cage 
Listen 
Just give us the chance That's all we ask 
Beryl 
Ask Mr Godby to come for a moment will you 
Who's he when he's at home 
You'll soon see 
Come in here cheeking me 
Come of it mother be a pal 
You saucy upstart 
Who are you calling an upstart 
You 
Where's the fire 
Where's the fire 
What's going on in here 
Mr Godby these gentlemen are annoying me 
We haven't done nothing have we 
Just asked for a couple of drinks 
They insulted me Mr Godby 
We never did anything of the kind 
Just having a little joke 
Hop it Both of you 
We've got a right to stay here 
You heard what I said Hop it 
Is this a free country or a sunday school 
Now look here 
Come on Johnnie 
Don't argue with the poor basket 
Hop it 
Thank you Albert 
What a nerve talking like that 
I'll get back to the gate 
I'll be seeing you later Albert 
Okay 
I really must go 
I'm going back to the flat 
I must go home I really must go home 
I'm going back to the flat 
I'm going home 
Excuse me I've forgotten something 
Darling 
It's raining 
It started just as I turned out of High street 
You had no umbrella and your coat's wet 
You mustn't catch cold That would never do 
I look an absolute fright 
Let me put that down 
Thank you 
I hope the fire will perk up 
I expect the wood was damp 
Yes I expect it was 
Do sit down darling 
We're both very foolish 
Alec I can't stay Really 
Just a little while a little while 
Quickly Quickly I must go 
Is that you Alec 
Yes 
What will you do about food 
I can ring down to the restaurant 
Yes of course 
It caters for all tastes 
You've hidden depths I never suspected 
Look here stephen I 
No explanations or apologies 
From the undignified scuffling I heard 
Such carryings on are unnecessary 
Actually it isn't in the least 
I must go now I'll collect my coat Goodbye 
Could you give me my latchkey 
I only have 2 and I'm afraid of losing them 
You're very angry aren't you 
No Not angry Just disappointed 
I ran until I couldn't any longer 
It was still raining but not very much 
I realised that I couldn't go home 
Do you remember 
Hello Fred is that you 
Yes It's me Laura 
I'm with Miss Lewis 
No I'll get a sandwich 
Yes of course as soon as I can 
All right Goodbye 
So very easy and so very degrading 
I started walking without purpose 
I was terrified that I might run into Alec 
I was sure he'd come after me 
Right at the other side of town 
There was nobody about and I lit a cigarette 
I sat there for ages I don't know how long 
Then I noticed a policeman 
He was looking at me rather suspiciously 
Presently he came up to me 
Feeling all right Miss 
Yes thank you 
Waiting for someone 
No I'm not waiting for anybody 
Don't go and catch cold It's a damp night 
I'm going now I've got to catch a train 
You sure you feel quite all right 
Quite Thank you Good night 
Good night Miss 
I felt like a criminal 
but it didn't seem any time at all 
Sten you are awful 
See you in the yard 
All right 
I'd like a glass of brandy please 
We're just closing 
Yes I can see but you're not quite closed 
Three star 
That'll do 
Have you got a piece of paper and an envelope 
You'll get that at the bookstall 
The bookstall's closed 
Please it's important I'd be much obliged 
All right Just a minute 
Thank you very much 
We close in a few minutes 
Yes I know 
I've been looking for you everywhere 
Please go away 
I've watched every train 
I can't leave you like this 
You must It's better really 
He doesn't know you 
We know we love each other 
That's all that matters 
I can't go on any longer 
Yes if you'd help me 
This is the beginning of the end 
But please not quite yet 
Very well not quite yet 
The feeling of guilt is too strong 
You can look at me now I'm all right 
Let's be very careful Let's prepare ourselves 
Very well 
I'm going away 
I see 
But not quite yet 
Please not quite yet 
That's the 10:10 
It's closing time 
Is it 
I shall have to lock up 
All right 
Promise me something 
What is it 
Where 
Outside the hospital 12:30 
All right I promise 
I've got to talk to you to explain 
About going away 
Yes 
Where will you go 
You can't give up your practice 
Where 
A long way away Johannesburg 
Alec 
I haven't told anybody not even Madeleine 
It's almost happening already 
When will you go 
Almost immediately In about two weeks time 
Quite near isn't it 
Do you want me to stay 
Do you want me to turn down the offer 
Don't be foolish Alec 
I'll do whatever you say 
That's unkind of you 
You're not angry with me are you 
Forgive me 
Forgive you for what 
For everything 
I'll forgive you if you'll forgive me 
Thursday 
All that was a week ago 
Today was our last day together 
Our very last together in all our lives 
I met him outside the hospital at 12/30 
12/30 this morning 
That was only this morning 
I lit cigarettes for him as we went along 
We had lunch in a village pub 
Those last few hours went by so quickly 
This is the last time with Alec 
I'll see it all again but without Alec 
Are you all right darling 
Yes I'm all right 
I wish I could think of something to say 
It doesn't matter not saying anything 
I'll miss my train and wait for yours 
I'd rather come to your platform 
Very well 
Do you think we'll ever see each other again 
I don't know Not for years anyway 
The children will be grown up 
Couldn't I write to you 
No Alec please We promised 
All right dear 
I do love you so much 
I love you with all my heart and soul 
I want to die 
If only I could die 
Yes I know I do too 
We've still got a few minutes 
What a lovely surprise 
This is Doctor Harvey 
How do you do 
Get me my cup of tea would you 
I can't drag my bones to the counter 
No please 
Oh dear 
No sugar 
It's in the spoon 
And then 
There's your train 
Yes I know 
Aren't you coming with us 
No I go in the opposite direction 
My practice is in Churley 
I see 
I'm a general practitioner 
Dr Harvey's going to Africa 
How thrilling 
I must go 
Yes 
Goodbye 
Goodbye 
He's got to get to the other platform 
Dolly went on talking but I wasn't listening 
I was listening for the sound of his train 
Then it did 
I said to myself/ He didn't go 
His courage failed and he couldn't go 
I prayed for that 
Just so I could see him for an instant 
But the minutes went by 
Is that the train 
Is that the Ketchwork train 
No it's the express 
The boat train 
That doesn't stop does it 
I want some chocolate please 
Milk or plain 
I meant to do it Fred I really meant to do it 
I stood there trembling right on the edge 
But I couldn't 
I wasn't brave enough 
I had no thoughts at all 
That's when I nearly fainted 
Laura 
Yes dear 
No 
Is there anything I can do to help 
Yes Fred You always help 
You've been a long way away 
Thank you for coming back to me 
I haven't shown you a very good time 
You're suffering 
I know I annoy you but I'm your oldest friend 
Though you keep silent I must speak 
Jean and I adore each other 
You know very well what I mean 
Observe him as I observe you 
Our happiness disturbs our friends 
I'm sorry but I'm happy 
Good night Jacques 
The play was long and I'm exhausted 
Good night 
Jean 
You frightened me 
Such a thing doesn't matter between us 
I'm tired 
I have no excuse It's unforgivable 
Do you like this case 
I love gold 
What a beautiful gift 
Thank you 
Anniversary 
What a monster I am 
Don't be so hard on yourself 
We all have something to blame ourselves for 
Even you 
Even me 
Tell me 
It might be better not to 
We vowed never to keep anything from each other 
That's the trouble 
I didn't want to hurt you You hurt me 
Here it is then 
It happened gradually without my realizing it 
I couldn't laugh I couldn't sleep 
I wondered if it was your fault but no 
You're as wonderful as ever 
You stay the same I'm the one who has changed 
I ask myself over and over: 
Why am I no longer impatient 
Why is waiting no longer a torment 
Why does my heart not leap up when he arrives 
Hélène 
My heart is drifting away from you 
I've called myself the worst names already 
Only one insult could wound me now: hypocrite 
Hélène you're wonderful 
All you thought I thought as well 
I kept silent suffering 
What a lesson you've taught me 
Really 
Really 
Hélène you're beautiful You're stunning 
It's like I'm seeing you for the first time 
We should congratulate ourselves 
Yes awful 
What now 
Neither of us has betrayed the other 
We can avoid a messy breakup 
We'll continue to see each other 
No deceit no surprises no disgust 
We'll be unique among our kind 
We each go our own way 
You've set such a high standard 
Can anyone ever know the future 
Perhaps you'll feel the same 
What if you don't find me when you return 
Anything's possible 
I might fall for another 
He couldn't compare to you but still 
That would be nobody's fault 
Good night Hélène 
Good night Jean 
Take all the calls I'm not home for anybody 
Anybody 
Anybody 
I'll have my revenge 
Agnès darling you look awful 
Thanks Always such cheerful news 
I say what I think 
Hurry up 
For those morons 
Leave them alone 
You're so tense We must take them home 
I hate potted flowers 
Especially when a drunkard sends them 
You're mad No I'm not 
You're very ill tempered this evening 
Sorry Mama I'm not angry just tired 
Follow that car 
Yes ma'am it's me 
Hélène What are you doing here 
Come with me 
You deserve a good scolding 
Not a word from you in three years 
I thought we no longer existed for you 
I might say the same of you 
It's Agnès' fame that led me to you 
Otherwise I'd never have found you 
You know about our troubles 
I suspected 
Financial ruin upon arriving in Paris 
May God keep you from poverty Hélène 
And Agnès 
An angel 
She's resigned to it 
She's a success 
Leave me alone 
Enough 
This is my home 
Agnès 
My little girl 
I'm no little girl 
I'm a whore 
Leave me in peace 
My God my God 
I'm so distraught 
And I was so happy to see you again 
Come on 
What a disaster 
It's over All over 
What are you saying 
Nothing is over I'm here 
No one can help us anymore 
It's not hopeless It's very simple 
Please calm down 
I can't go on 
Why would you care about women like us 
But we can't 
Agnès must stop showing herself off in public 
I have debts I'll take care of them 
If you don't want them to they won't 
Please not a word of thanks 
Just follow my advice 
You're an angel We are all angels 
Obey me and don't worry 
You'll leave here tomorrow 
Now calm down and get some rest 
Don't bother seeing me out 
Agnès 
What a gloomy place A piano 
I'm not supposed to dance but we have music 
No one's stopping you 
Dance 
Are you sure all this is necessary 
I do Our life was a nightmare 
And this is a dream 
Look 
I call this a prison 
Trees 
You have a lovely view of the square 
Am I allowed to look outside 
Now don't forget our agreement: 
You mustn't thank me 
Agnès must be bored staying in all the time 
She'll be glad to get out 
At the waterfall 
Precisely 
So you're shutting yourself in 
You have a secret Tell me 
We said we would tell each other everything 
People bore me Even Jacques 
I don't want to see him 
You still love me Perhaps 
And you behave like a saint 
Perhaps 
Now I believe you're capable of any heroism 
I can be heroic if I must 
But why do you live so alone 
So removed from everything 
You are made to be loved and admired 
It's no use dearJean 
My heart is at peace 
So you recommend Jacques 
I do 
Is that your advice as a friend 
As a friend 
And I'm taking you to a show 
On such a sunny day 
I'd hate to be cooped up in the dark 
We'll go for a stroll then 
Where 
Anywhere 
The Bois de Boulogne 
Faces from the past 
I'd like you to meet one of my dearest friends 
What do you think of her 
I hardly looked at her 
It's her gaze that I like 
Phone 
Hello 
We just got in 
What 
Happy 
You're happy 
So are we my dear 
See you soon 
Hélène is happy About what 
Only to avoid your babbling lady friends 
But there are other women Others 
Have you seen the ladies from the Bois again 
Why no 
What a shame 
You like my ladies from the Bois 
Very perceptive of you 
Why 
Out of tact and scruples 
Are they so poor 
They surprise me I admire them 
Do you think I could see them entertain them 
Certainly not 
You have no idea what that girl is like 
No idea at all 
She is beyond anyone's reach 
If I were to go would they throw me out 
You 
Go to Port Royal Square 
Port Royal Square 
Of course they would 
I should just give up the whole idea 
That would be wise 
I'd rather warn you than console you 
See you tomorrow 
See you tomorrow 
He won't be back tomorrow 
I'm in luck 
I'm not Leave me alone 
Was that you at the waterfall 
I had forgotten 
I'm so happy I was certain I'd find you 
Certain 
Is that string called indiscretion No 
Certainty 
I must go So soon 
Do you like rain that much 
Is it raining 
The rain goes on and on Yes on and on 
Where are you going 
To get an umbrella 
For whom 
You 
Don't bother 
I hoped I could say hello to your mother 
What a pity She's out Take her umbrella 
Her umbrella 
Take it 
You're not going down again I insist 
I won't damage it I'll bring it back 
A souvenir 
Will you see her soon 
I rarely see her And you 
Once a year We don't see anybody 
And I'll thank you to remember that 
Follow your string now and don't lose your way 
Why the long face 
You wouldn't understand 
Understand what 
You lend an umbrella 
It's not the umbrella 
Those flowers ruin everything 
But they bring joy my angel 
Now look 
Today it closes in their face and flowers 
Tomorrow there'll be more We'll refuse 
Yet I'm still the same girl 
You shouldn't have lent him that umbrella 
But it was my umbrella 
I'm sorry Mama 
But believe me I had to 
And be simple Simple 
Yes simple like me 
I take things as they come 
I ask of things only what they wish to give 
Going out 
Where 
To recover our peace of mind 
Agnès what is it 
Can't you guess 
Someone I know 
Yes 
Then I can guess 
He was waiting for me in front of our place 
I was on my way home He escorted me to my door 
You shouldn't have received him the first time 
I sent him away 
It was raining Was I right to do so 
I approve Sincerely 
Sincerely 
He'll come back What should I do 
Show him the door 
Take my advice 
I understand But I will help you 
Help me 
In any way I can 
I'm such a fool Why 
I was afraid Afraid of what 
Afraid that's all 
I was so foolish 
Do you feel better now 
You trust me 
Yes I do Good 
Now sit down You're going to write a letter 
To whom 
To me 
To you 
It'll be easy We'll write it together 
Where have you been 
No one's seen you for days 
I've just had a fascinating experience 
Climbing the stairs I told myself 
Luckily I landed on the right 
Despair 
I must speak even if I hurt you 
I'm ill I can't be without her 
I managed to see her again 
Whom 
The girl from the Bois 
I found their haven thanks to you 
Me 
Did I give you the address 
Not you Your mouth 
You must do me a favor What 
The ladies from the Square turn me away 
They never go out and they receive no one 
You must give me this one chance 
I'll think about it on one condition: 
You must quit harassing them with your advances 
You're causing me trouble 
If you need proof here is the letter 
It's from Agnès Read it 
Her writing is so like her 
Without pretense Childlike and noble 
This is like Cinderella's slipper 
If I found a letter like this in the street 
That's your only reaction 
I'll leave them alone I promise 
What are you dragging me into 
Why put me in such an impossible position 
Work out the affairs of your heart on your own 
Hélène you don't understand 
This is no mere whim 
No Hélène 
I love her 
I'm losing my head I'm capable of anything 
Agnès' face is like a gash across my heart 
How you must love her 
When will I see her again 
And you're proud of it 
When will I see her again 
I don't know 
I wish you'd stop playing that piano 
I thought my music would soothe your pain 
You won't let me see her 
You're crazy my dear There's no cure for you 
There is but you won't give it to me 
It isn't that I won't 
I can't 
Jean 
Let me leave 
Why are you leaving 
I don't like the piano 
What are you going to do 
Disappear 
Disappear where 
Never see her or you or anyone ever again 
This is all so absurd 
Could it really be 
I'm as crazy as you are 
You can make them see me 
No 
But I can give chance a hand 
Give me some time No it must be soon 
Tomorrow 
You're another person when you dance 
You light up like a chandelier 
What now 
I've decided to quit dancing and dressing up 
I need to put it all behind me 
Agnès my little girl 
What's wrong 
Nothing 
Nothing 
I thought you were dead Nothing at all 
I'll never dance again 
It was my heart 
Telephone 
The telephone I'll go 
No I will 
Be reasonable and go lie down 
This evening 
Yes of course my dear 
Certainly with pleasure 
We're invited to Hélène's 
Agnès is here Speak to her 
I'd be delighted See you tonight 
Will it be just us 
Of course 
Are you blaming me 
Not at all 
I promised 
Good evening Hélène 
Yes you are 
But since you're here you might as well stay 
You know everyone Have a seat 
We forgive you 
Very lovely 
The house is full of them 
It looks like a greenhouse Like a dream 
Agnès was delighted She was 
I think broken glasses 
You said it at the same time Make a wish 
Yes let's I've made mine 
And I mine 
Wouldn't it be funny if we made the same wish 
What a disaster 
I mean dinner 
The awkwardness the restraint the uneasiness 
Their hasty escape 
It was adorable 
Still crazy 
More than ever 
I have to have that girl 
And perhaps you will 
But how 
We'll see 
I know her my dearJean 
It's quite clear 
Agnès will you kindly explain your behavior 
That man is charming 
So unlike the others we've met 
You must admit he's something else 
Why the long face and the broken glasses 
Why leave in such a hurry 
Why embarrass Hélène like that 
It was quite uncalled for 
Good night dear 
Are you crying 
Leave me alone 
I never want to see Hélène or him again 
All what 
Tell me 
It's impossible to explain 
I'm afraid that's impossible darling 
She plays with men and she's playing with us 
Men are fools Too bad for him 
Promise me 
It's tragic 
What's sad is I can't do anything anymore 
I had a career once Don't torment yourself 
Make whom happy 
I'm thinking of you my angel Now go to sleep 
Oh it's you I knew it 
I had to come 
I'm sorry but I can't ask you in 
Come in 
Can't I see her 
No she mustn't even suspect you came by 
Our place is very small 
So this is where she lives and sleeps 
The lamp is her 
These flowers are her 
This cushion this frame it's all her 
Her room Agnès' room 
Her books 
Her pictures 
Agnès at age five and ten 
On horseback at 1 6 
What's that 
A costume 
She likes to dress up She used to 
She'd never accept 
We'll see She detects the slightest lie 
No no letters Go quickly 
Mama we are saved 
From what 
From Hélène and everybody 
I found a job 
What's the matter Nothing 
A real job 
Somebody looked through my things 
I was tidying up Your costume fell down 
And what's this 
Even if you never come 
I will wait for you every day at the waterfall 
Agnès tell me about your job 
What kind of work is it exactly 
Don't be rash Agnès 
I'm not being rash Mama 
Shall I lock you in 
Please just give me a second 
Do those men frighten you 
Isn't there another exit 
No and they're not leaving 
The price of fame What fame 
They want autographs 
Come on everyone knows you 
What's wrong 
It's hopeless 
There's no way out of this 
Explain it to me Mama I don't understand 
Always I told you 
There's no hope I give up 
Men are vicious Not all of them 
Whom are you referring to 
You're so impatient Like a bull at a gate 
Just let things be 
Look 
What's this 
Put them on 
Where did they come from 
Put them on and look at yourself in the mirror 
See how beautiful you are 
Hello Agnès 
What lovely pearl earrings 
Take them off right now 
You're hopeless How could you 
You've got it wrong 
You must keep an eye on her my dear 
Stop her from doing these things 
Don't destroy everything I've built 
But I suppose it's my fault 
I can lighten the load 
Yes 
Then help me to help you 
You promise 
Yes Hélène 
I think you're right I promise 
I'm not the courageous type 
And yet 
Where are you going 
Where are you going Answer me 
I'm sure she's up to something foolish 
She hasn't been the same since yesterday 
I told you to watch her 
You asked for it Asked for what 
The worst for you 
Where is she 
If I knew we'd try to save her 
No doubt she's outdoing herself this time 
She'll end up ruining everything 
A letter 
Is it bad news 
Very bad 
Then I don't want it 
Please read it I insist 
I'll tear it up No 
Come Let's get out of the rain 
So you live in this cave How odd 
I've only a moment to tell you so much 
Let's make this moment last forever 
We can do it 
We can make it last an entire lifetime Agnès 
Let's go far away 
You're not saying no 
I don't frighten you 
Tell me this isn't some absurd dream 
Read this letter 
We'll read it together one day in the sun 
There's a train at 7:00 waiting to take us away 
We just have time 
Take a cab and meet me at the station 
Gare de Lyon at 7:00 
Where are you going 
Where have you been 
Did you tell him everything 
I told him nothing 
You love him 
My dear friend you are very foolish 
Yes I am foolish You were right 
What about your work 
I can't work 
I can't talk to anyone anymore 
I can't read or write or live anymore 
I haven't a shred of will left 
I'm a walking ghost 
I wish I could just sleep 
My dear we've come 
Excuse me 
Hello 
Speaking 
Go then my dear friend 
What 
I'm not helping you 
That's all I'm doing helping you 
It's true 
What do you expect me to do 
Then go 
I don't understand a word you're saying 
I don't know if we are of use to you in any way 
Not in the slightest 
Consent 
I'd like to hear you say she's free 
Free 
I set you both totally free 
Married 
You're such an odd one my dear Agnès 
Or shall I tell him 
Mama let's go 
Marriage is out of the question 
I won't do it Why 
People aren't criminals Agnès 
Be a woman Fight 
Don't spoil your life forever 
You'll tell him afterward 
Things will change then 
In any case you no longer have a choice 
Let's go 
How many miles 
Sixty round trip 
Well 
My mind is made up for good 
God knows you and I are not the marrying kind 
Oh leave me out of this 
Could you see yourself getting married 
Yes and today I can tell you that 
But there's only one man I would marry 
Who 
You 
You disapprove of my marriage 
She's perfect for you You're very lucky 
I'm so glad to hear you say that 
I put my fate in your hands 
Not so fast my dearJean 
This isn't about them It's about you 
I must know more about this 
If things work out I'm at their disposal 
They seem to prefer to avoid people 
If they like we can have a simple wedding 
On the contrary 
I envision a huge wedding 
But I repeat: 
Slow down 
No make it as quickly as possible 
I could never do enough for your happiness 
I'm afraid for you 
Look at people's expressions 
Ask some questions 
About what 
And whom should I ask 
Agnès 
Where's Agnès 
I don't know 
Come along 
Come 
I can't face them or anyone anymore 
Come along 
Kill me but don't drag me out there 
Let go 
Do what you like with me I deserve it 
But I beg of you Let go 
Madame has fainted Look after her 
Hélène 
You look upset What's wrong 
What is this horrible mystery I'm involved in 
I don't understand a thing 
It's quite simple 
You've married a tramp 
She was a cabaret dancer 
You 
Yes me 
You 
Don't be absurd 
You're suddenly so sentimental 
You're horrid 
Return to Agnès' side 
And there are plenty of them 
She's very ill She's fainted three times 
Her heart may fail any minute 
I'm very worried We must do something 
Please madame let me by 
You're here 
In time perhaps you'll forgive me 
But don't hurry 
So many honest girls become dishonest women 
Perhaps I'll show the opposite can happen 
I'm not yet worthy to have you come close to me 
Wait 
Just leave me a little hope 
Then you can judge my behavior 
I'll be happy if you can bear my presence 
Show me a corner of your house where I can live 
I'll stay there without protest 
I'm not evil 
I know myself 
I was weak 
I lacked the courage to tell you the truth 
Remember the letter you wouldn't read 
It wasn't pleasant 
You can forget me 
I won't trouble you anymore 
It will be easy 
Hold on to life with all your strength 
Hold on to me 
I love you You can't leave me 
Try to hold on Fight 
I am fighting 
You're my wife I love you 
Stay with me 
I'll try 
That's an order You can't disobey 
Stay with me 
I will stay 
THE END 
How many shirts are you taking 
Three 
I'm taking five 
Five 
We'll make it a long wonderful weekend 
Sounds long all right 
Wick please 
Why this emphasis on liquids 
Very dull liquids 
Sorry Don 
What for 
You really feel up to writing 
Why not 
After what you've been through 
I haven't touched the stuff for 1 0 days now 
I know I know you haven't 
Where is the typewriter 
In the living room 
In the closet 
Towards the back 
Are you sure it's in the closet 
I can't find it 
Well look by the desk 
Isn't it under your bed 
Did you find it 
Oh sure 
Here it is 
Nobody will disturb you I'll see to it 
I'm not going near that club 
Why not 
Or rather the nurse and the invalid 
Stop it Nobody there knows about you 
The leper is back Hide your liquor 
That's Helen 
I'll take it 
Helen 
Hello Wick Where's Don 
I'm glad I made it I was afraid you'd be gone 
Presents 
And darling have a wonderful time 
And don't forget: 
lots of sleep lots of milk 
Bend down 
So long Wick 
What concert 
Carnegie Hall 
Who are you going with 
Nobody 
Nobody 
What are they playing 
Sounds wonderful 
Good bye boys 
See you Monday 
Tuesday 
Wait a minute 
I just had a crazy idea 
For instance 
Who says we have to take the 3:1 5 train 
We could go on the 6:30 
What are you talking about 
She's got two tickets hasn't she 
No I'm not going to upset any of your plans 
You're going on the 3:1 5 
Helen that's so silly 
A whale of a concert an empty seat next to you 
Everything's all set 
Nothing doing We're going 
Wick is right 
Five to 3:00 
You see 
Don't be so stubborn 
All right go ahead 
Just a minute 
I'm not going 
Then what are we talking about 
I want you to go you and Helen 
Me and Helen 
That's the idea Who likes Brahms you or I 
Since when don't you like Brahms 
I'll just finish packing take a nap 
Nonsense 
If anybody goes Helen's your girl 
There's something in that Don 
What's more you shouldn't be alone 
I shouldn't 
I'm not to be trusted is that it 
Really darling 
After what you've been through 
I couldn't sit through it with all those people 
Is that such an extraordinary thing to want 
Don't act so outraged Would you mind 
All right 
Anything else 
Please boys 
Come on Helen 
You'll stay right here 
Where would I go 
Then you'll be here when we get back 
I'm not leaving this apartment 
You told us a good many things 
We've got to trust Don That's the only way 
Sorry Don Let's go Helen 
So long Don 
So long 
Bend down 
What's this 
Whiskey isn't it 
How did it get there 
I don't know 
I guess I must have put it there 
Yes you must 
Maybe the one before I don't know 
Then you won't mind 
Mind what 
Now you trot along with Helen 
Why 
Because of that 
I don't leave on your blasted weekend 
Let's go 
You'll be good won't you darling 
Yes 
Will you stop watching me all the time 
Let me work it out my way I'm trying 
I'm trying 
We know you're trying 
Sure 
So long 
Come on He'll be all right 
What if he goes out and buys another bottle 
He hasn't a nickel 
Who is it 
Who is it 
Mrs Foley I've come to clean up 
Does it have to be today 
Come on Monday 
All right Mr Birnam 
Is your brother in 
No he isn't 
What about my money 
Didn't he leave my money 
What money 
My ten dollars 
Didn't he leave it 
Probably 
Where would he leave it 
In the kitchen 
Where in the kitchen 
In the sugar bowl 
just a minute 
I wanted to do some shopping 
You'll get it Monday 
All right Mr Birnam 
Two bottles of rye 
I'm sorry Mr Birnam 
What are you sorry about 
Your brother was in 
Two bottles of rye 
What brand 
You know what brand The cheapest 
Liquor's all one anyway 
You want a bag 
Yes I want a bag 
I can't stop anybody can I 
Not unless you're a minor 
I'm buying this to refill my cigarette lighter 
Thank you 
Good afternoon Mrs Deveridge 
Hello Mr Birnam 
That's the nice young man who drinks 
How is my very good friend Nat today 
Yes Mr Birnam 
This being an especially fine afternoon 
I have decided to ask your hand in marriage 
Just one that's all 
It can't be done 
It can't 
Let me guess why 
One straight rye 
That was the idea 
Don't wipe it away 
Let me have my little vicious circle 
No end no beginning 
What time is it 
A quarter of 4:00 
Good We have the whole afternoon together 
The other bottle Come here 
That one I'm tucking into my brother's suitcase 
Then while he's greeting the caretaker 
I can't be cut off completely That's the devil 
That's what drives you crazy 
Yeah I know a lot of guys like that 
They take a bottle and put it on the shelf 
Shall we dance 
You're awfully pretty Mr Birnam 
I bet you tell that to all the boys 
Why natch 
Only with you it's on the level 
Sit down 
No thanks 
Him 
I bet he wears arch supporters 
He's just an old friend of the folks 
Lovely gentleman He buys me scotch 
Don't be ridic 
Gloria please 
I'm going away for the weekend Some other time 
I'm just crazy about the back of your hair 
Nat weave me another 
You'd better take it easy 
Oh don't worry about me 
just let me know when it's a quarter of 6:00 
Come on join me One little jigger of dreams 
No thanks 
You don't approve of drinking 
Not the way you drink 
It shrinks my liver doesn't it 
It pickles my kidneys yes 
But what does it do to my mind 
Suddenly I'm above the ordinary 
I'm confident supremely confident 
I'm walking a tightrope over Niagra Falls 
I'm one of the great ones 
I'm Michelangelo molding the beard of Moses 
I'm van Gogh painting pure sunlight 
I'm Horowitz playing the Emperor Concerto 
I'm W Shakespeare 
And out there it's not 3rd Avenue any longer 
Come here 
What difference does it make 
You're not really going 
I certainly am 
You can't leave him alone four days 
Yes I can 
I can't look out for him You know how he gets 
He'll be run over by a car He'll be arrested 
If it happens it happens and I hope it does 
You can't mean that 
Yes I do 
It's terrible I know but I mean it 
For heaven's sakes 
Who are we fooling 
We've tried everything haven't we 
How often have I beaten him up 
He's a sick person 
He won't accept our help He hates us 
He wants to be alone with that bottle of his 
It's all he gives a hang about 
Why kid ourselves 
He's a hopeless alcoholic 
Mr Birnam you ought to go home It's late 
You ought to go home on account of your brother 
Who says so 
You said you're going away somewhere 
Don't you remember 
What time is it 
Ten past 6:00 
Why didn't you tell me 
Your change 
Taxi Taxi 
I'll give you a lift as far as Grand Central 
No thanks I'm gonna wait here 
You're crazy 
Because I won't give up 
Maybe I am 
Let go of him Give yourself a chance 
Good bye Wick 
I thought you was going away for the weekend 
What are you doing 
Give me a drink 
Stop it and give me a drink Come on Come on 
Okay 
What young lady 
The one with the leopard coat 
Yeah 
She acted like she just happened to drop in 
But I know she was making the rounds after you 
What did you say 
You haven't been in for two weeks 
Why don't you cut it short 
I can't cut it short 
How about you eating some of this 
Take it away 
You gotta eat something sometime 
just give me another drink 
Mr Birnam this is the morning 
Okay if I eat 
A little to one side 
Are you ever scared when you wake up 
So scared the sweat starts out of you 
No not you With you it's simple 
You ever lie in your bed looking at the window 
Is it getting lighter 
Is it getting darker 
Is it dawn or is it dusk 
That's a terrifying problem 
Because if it's dawn you're dead 
You can't last until 9:00 
Or it may be Sunday That's the worst 
Why 
Because we gotta go to church once in a while 
Yeah when a guy needs it most 
What happened to those two quarts 
Did you polish them off last night 
What two quarts 
The two bottles you had 
That's right I did have two bottles didn't I 
I hid one of them I've still got it 
I'm a capitalist I've got untapped reserves 
I'm rich 
Didn't you go away for the weekend 
Apparently not 
Was there a gentleman asking for me 
Not to my knowledge 
Another friend of the folks 
More a friend of a friend of the folks 
Like Grant's tomb for instance 
Sometimes I wish you came from Albany 
Yeah 
Where would you take me 
Lots of places 
Music Hall the New Yorker roof maybe 
I see us as setting out for that 
Do you know Hamlet 
I know 44th Street 
I'd like to give it to you 
Dinner later I think Nothing before 
Not even a pretzel 
Can I have a glass of water 
This is Nat's bar isn't it 
That's what the man said 
I'm looking for a young lady name of Gloria 
Are you Miss Gloria 
Me 
No I'm not 
I just live with Gloria She's not here 
She isn't 
She's sick She went to the hospital 
Ruptured appendix middle of last night 
Went like that Scared the life out of me 
Oh that's terrible 
Good bye 
Good bye 
Could I have a word with you 
No thanks Thanks a lot but no thanks 
When I've got a chance to go out with you 
Don't be ridic 
Is our engagement definite 
You meant it didn't you 
Surely surely 
You're gonna call for me aren't you 
What time do you suggest 
How's 8:00 
8:00's fine 
I got the Indian sign in me I say 
I'll be there 
Second floor front 
Mr Birnam all I got is a semiformal 
Will that be all right 
That'll be fine 
So long Nat 
One last one 
Do me a favor will you Buy it somewhere else 
What's the matter 
What's the idea of pulling her leg 
You're not gonna take her out 
Who says I'm not 
You're drunk and just making with the mouth 
Give me a drink 
That other dame the lady I mean 
I don't like what you're doing to her 
Oh shut up 
Give me a drink 
That's an awful high class young lady 
You bet she is 
How did she get mixed up with a guy 
who sops it up like you do 
It's a problem isn't it 
How did she get mixed up with him 
Why does he drink 
Why doesn't he stop 
How did she get mixed up with him 
Why does he drink Why doesn't he stop 
That's my novel 
I oughta start writing it out in the country 
A horror story 
You know what I'm gonna call my novel 
The Bottle 
That's all Very simply The Bottle 
I've got it all here in my mind 
Let me tell you the first chapter 
Check your hat and coat sir 
Here 
Did you forget something 
No just going home if it's all right with you 
This isn't yours is it 
It certainly isn't 
That's what is says 41 7 
I don't care what it says 
The checks must've gotten mixed up 
Maybe they did 
About a thousand 
I can find it 
That's against regulations sir 
You can get your coat tomorrow 
Tomorrow 
Then what do you suggest 
Wait till the other party arrives and swap 
I want my coat 
You're a great help 
That's my coat you've got 
And that's mine thank heaven 
They mixed up the checks 
I thought you'd never come 
You couldn't have waited so long 
Since the first aria of the first act 
Do you always drop in just for the overture 
just a minute 
My umbrella if you don't mind 
Catch 
Thank you very much 
I'm terribly sorry 
Just rude I guess 
Somebody should talk to your mother 
They tried Miss St John 
My name's not St John 
St Joseph then 
St James 
First name Hilda or Helen or Harriet maybe 
Helen 
All right Helen 
I also know you come from Toledo Ohio 
You do How 
Maybe I should've explored your coat 
But you didn't though 
Didn't have time 
Good My name is Don Birnam 
How do you do 
Well how do you like New York 
Love it 
You intend to stay long 
Oh 60 years perhaps 
I live here now I have a job 
Doing what 
Time Magazine 
Perhaps you can do something for me 
Yes 
Help me become Man of the Year 
Delighted 
What do you do 
Yes what do I do 
I'm a writer I've just started a novel 
In that case why don't you write short stories 
I have some of those first paragraph 
They'll love that in Toledo 
Oh by the way 
I don't know 
Don't worry 
But I do 
To be really safe we should go together 
We could 
Are you in the phone book 
Yes but I'm not home very much 
I'd call you at your office 
All right 
Would you like a taxi 
No thanks I'm taking the subway 
Very sensible As a matter of fact 
If you like I'll take you along 
Good bye Mr Birnam 
Good bye 
Who threw that 
It fell out of my pocket 
Do you always carry those things 
Well no 
See that he gets hot lemonade and some aspirin 
Oh Miss St James 
Yes 
What kind of party did you ask me to 
A cocktail party 
Does the invitation still stand 
Of course Come on 
For two weeks for six weeks 
In love huh 
That's what's gonna be so hard to write 
It's so simple 
Pour it Nat 
He thinks he's cured 
But it's not Nat Not quite 
Because one day one terrible day 
Go on 
They stay at the Hotel Manhattan 
One o'clock lobby of the hotel 
That wasn't enough not for New York 
Didn't want to get all tired out 
On account of meeting that young man 
Now Mother 
Who did you get that haircut for 
I wonder what's keeping Helen 
She'll be here 
This Birnam fellow went to Cornell didn't he 
I believe so 
He never graduated 
I wonder why 
How old is he 
Thirty three 
I wish Helen wasn't so vague 
Maybe he has a little money 
Some people do you know Father 
He ought to have a job anyway 
He's a writer 
What did he write 
I never heard his name 
Father relax 
You always expect the worst 
We ought to know a few things about him 
Hotel Manhattan 
Could you page Miss Helen St James 
St James Yes she's in the lobby 
Helen 
Don 
Oh nothing serious I'll be there 
Good bye 
Turn off that light 
Turn it off 
For heaven's sake 
What happened 
Come on 
I couldn't face it 
Couldn't face what 
Didn't you go to see them 
Certainly I went 1 :00 sharp 
I saw them all right only they didn't see me 
How was that 
Such nice respectable people 
I just couldn't do it not cold 
So you had another and another 
You poor idiot 
Will you call her 
Tell her something 
Tell her I'm sick tell her I'm dead 
Will you call 
Yes I'll call 
What a gentleman I am a prince 
Which hotel is it 
The Manhattan 
Mr and Mrs Charles St James ofToledo Ohio 
Get up 
just a minute Helen 
Hello Wick Is Don here 
Don 
No 
Any idea where he could be 
Wasn't he meeting you 
Mother's beginning to think I just made him up 
Do you suppose something happened to him 
Nonsense 
Where did he call you from 
I don't know 
Where 
Philadelphia 
What's he doing there 
There's an opening at the Enquirer 
He didn't tell me a word about it 
I'm not supposed to tell you either 
He wanted it to be a surprise 
He did 
Yes 
Or would it 
With him in Philadelphia and me in New York 
Of course not 
Maybe I'm a bit prejudiced What are you doing 
Nothing 
Where did that bottle come from 
It just rolled out 
From under the couch 
Yes 
Is that Don's bottle 
What makes you think that 
There was a bottle the first time we met 
There was 
Fell out of Don's pocket 
That was for me 
This one's mine too 
Don thinks I drink too much 
I promised to go on the wagon 
I hid the bottle so he wouldn't see it 
I'm sorry 
I shouldn't have started asking questions 
It's really none of my business 
Forget it 
I better be getting back to the hotel 
Don's probably there already 
And don't worry 
I won't mention a word of it to him 
Thank you 
Good bye 
I'm sorry 
I can't let you go not like this 
Shut your mouth Don 
I'll take you downstairs 
Thanks very much for your Philadelphia story 
Nice try 
That looks so silly on you 
Don't listen to him 
She doesn't have to 
just look at the two of us 
What is all this covering up 
Come on She'd have found out sooner or later 
Stop it both of you 
Don's a little tight 
Most people drink a little 
A lot of them get tight once in a while 
What I'm trying to say is I'm not a drinker 
I'm a drunk 
They had to put me away once 
He went to a cure 
Which didn't take 
For my sake 
We're talking about you 
Is it really that bad 
Yes it is 
You drink too much and that's not fatal 
One cure didn't take There are others 
Of course there are 
This has a familiar ring 
But there must be a reason why you drink 
The right doctor could find it 
I'm way ahead of the right doctor 
I know the reason 
The reason is me what I am 
What is it you wanna be so much that you're not 
A writer 
Silly isn't it 
In college I passed for a genius 
Boy was I hot Hemingway stuff 
I reached my peak when I was 1 9 
My mother bought me a brand new typewriter 
I moved right in on New York 
And the second I dropped 
The public wasn't ready for that one 
I started a third and a forth 
Don Birnam he'd whisper 
It's not good enough not that way 
So I had a couple What a great idea that was 
That made all the difference 
Suddenly I could see the whole thing 
And that guy would pop up again 
What guy 
Who are you talking about 
Don the Drunk and Don the Writer 
The drunk would say to the writer 
It's always good for ten dollars 
Such humorous words 
I was gonna do it on my 30th birthday 
The other Don wanted us to have a drink first 
He always wants us to have a drink first 
The flop suicide of a flop writer 
Sure take a nice job 
Public accountant real estate salesman 
I haven't the guts 
Most men lead lives of quiet desperation 
I can't take quiet desperation 
But you are a writer 
Come on Let's face reality 
I'm 33 I'm living on the charity of my brother 
All out of the bigness of his heart 
And it is a big heart and a patient one 
I've only been carrying you along for 
Shut up 
I've never done anything 
Zero zero zero 
Now you shut up 
We'll straighten it out Look 
Wick has the misfortune of being my brother 
You just happened to walk in on this 
And walk fast and don't turn back 
Why don't you make some coffee 
Strong three cups 
Look do yourself a favor Go on Clear out 
Because I've got a rival 
Because you're in love with this 
Bend down 
All right 
That was three years ago 
Three years of it 
And what 
How's it come out 
I haven't figured that far 
Want me to tell you 
And then 
You think so 
And that pulls him up and snaps him out of it 
This guy 
Not from where I sit 
Oh shut up 
I wanna do it now It's all there You heard it 
Yes Mr Birnam 
That's why I didn't go away 
This time I'm gonna do it 
Maybe you will

It doesn't matter what I think 
Wick'll get you back your coat

I was the only one that really understood you 
And now I know what it is: a sponge 
I asked you not to make a scene

You can get as drunk as you like for all I care 
Thank you 
Why

He had permission 
How much did you give him 
He didn't want any money 
He wanted to swap it 
Swap it 
For what 
Something he hocked here a long while back 
What 
A gun 
A gun 
Now if you want the coat back I can 
What is it Helen 
What's the matter 
Nothing 
What do you want here 
I couldn't get a taxi 
Sure How about my raincoat

Good bye Helen 
What are you looking for 
Would you care to wear my derby 
Any old thing Any old scarf 
All right 
Here you are Thank you 
So long 
Was there 
Like to know where I put it 
Don't you want a drink Don

Here it is Right here 
Why don't you have one Just one

Nothing 
I told you I don't feel like a drink Not now

Let me stay Please 
Good bye 
Don't let me bend for nothing 
You need this Don 
Drink it 
I want you to drink it 
I'll get you more I'll get you all you want 
What kind of talk is that 
I'd rather you be drunk than dead 
Who wants to be dead 
Stop lying to me 
Give it to me 
All right Now go No fuss please 
I won't You've made up your mind 
But could you tell me why 
Why 
That's not true We love you 
Then for me 
Selfish again 
That's a sad final word Don 
Look at it this way: 
He died over this weekend Did he 
What did he die of 
A lot of things 
Of alcohol Of moral anemia 
Oh that Don Birnam 
And now you want to kill the other 
What other 
He's through 
I know you have 
Let me get it over 
It's too late I wouldn't know how to start 
Can't be done 
Other people have stopped 
People with a purpose with something to do 
But you've got talent and ambition 
Ambition 
That's dead long ago That's drowned 
No it isn't You still have it 
Quit trying to stall me Helen It's too late 
A miracle 
Yes 
If I could just make you un 
Yes 
If I could just make you un 
Who is it 
It's me Mr Birnam 
What is it Nat 
I got something for you 
I hope I ain't intruding' 
What is it 
She writes good I oiled her up a little 
And I didn't oil her up so you can hock her 
I'll take it Nat 
Hello miss 
Thank you Nat 
How are them lilacs in Ohio 
Well Don here it is What do you say now 
Say about what 
This 
It'll clear up again 
No you won't 
You've forgotten what it feels like to be well 
What am I going to write about 
What you've always wanted 
Where was the page I found 
The Bottle A novel by Don Birnam 
What was that to be 
About a messed up life 
About a man and a woman and a bottle 
Tell it all: To whom it may concern 
And it concerns so many 
Yeah 
I'll fix us some breakfast 
We have quite a supply of milk 
You'll notice I didn't even find the first line 
Only now 
Only now you know the ending 
Imagine Wick standing in front of a bookstore 
Didn't I always tell you 
I'm gonna put this weekend down 
Why not 
The way I stood in there packing 
Only my mind wasn't on the suitcase 
It wasn't on the weekend 
My mind was hanging outside the window 
It was suspended just about 1 8 inches below 
Eighteen I think you said sir 
Shall I wait sir 
I'm sorry my lord Mr Hallward is not at home 
Mr Hallward doesn't wish to be disturbed 
Who is he 
I shall not send it anywhere 
But why 
I've put too much of myself into it 
I knew you'd laugh but it's true all the same 
Of course I'm not like him 
And I'm glad of it The Wisdom of Buddha 
Dorian Gray Is that his name 
Yes I didn't intend to tell it to you 
Why didn't you intend to tell me his name 
I suppose that sounds foolish to you 
Come into the garden 
It doesn't sound foolish to me at all 
I'm afraid this will seem so 
There is something I can't quite understand 
Something mystic about it 
Mystic 
I want to meet this extraordinary young man 
Now I remember Remember what Harry 
Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray 
I'm glad you didn't meet Dorian Gray 
Why I don't want you to meet him 
Who's that at your piano Basil 
You've come early today Dorian 
Have I 
Depends on how you sit this afternoon 
Please go on Mr Gray You play brilliantly 
You shouldn't go in for philanthropy 
Am I to go Mr Gray 
Stay and tell me why not philanthropy 
Sit down then Harry 
Have you really a bad influence Lord Henry 
Why 
Because the aim of life is self development 
To realize one's nature perfectly 
That's what we're here for 
The gods have been good to you Mr Gray 
Why do you say that 
I don't feel that Lord Henry 
What the gods give they quickly take away 
The world is yours for a season 
I'm glad you met Lord Henry 
Are you glad Mr Gray 
That's a dreadful word 
But I believe our hostess has appeared 
Could I sign it too 
Well I think you're entitled to 
Since you haven't missed a sitting 
I like Dorian best 
Won't you Dorian 
Of course I shall darling 
What about me young lady 
Has Dorian Gray stolen you from me completely 
Goodbye Lord Henry 
She'll be as lovely as your sister was Basil 
I must congratulate you Basil 
Look at yourself Mr Gray 
If it were only the other way 
I should object strongly 
Perhaps a cup of tea will bring you around 
You'll have some too won't you Harry 
Or do you object to such simple pleasures 
It's more than a painting It's part of myself 
I will if Dorian wants it 
For that I would give everything 
I would give my soul for that 
If you please sir 
I give you the sweetheart of the Two Turtles 
Our own Sibyl Vane 
Snow was very plentiful And crumbs were very few 
Sung by a pet canary there 
A handsome yellow bird 
Will you share my cage with me 
And in plaintive tones said she 
On a leafless tree 
Than a prisoner be 
In a cage of gold 
Come my delightful dove 
The spoiled and petted yellow bird 
Could scarce believe it true 
That a common sparrow should refuse 
A bird with blood so blue 
He told her the advantages Of riches and of gold 
She answered that her liberty 
For gold could not be sold 
And the wintry winds so blow 
Stay with me my little dearie 
For without you it would be dreary 
But she only sighed Ah no 
Goodbye little yellow bird 
I'd gladly mate with you 
I love you little yellow bird 
But I love my freedom too 
So goodbye little yellow bird 
I'd rather brave the cold 
On a leafless tree 
Than a prisoner be 
In a cage 
Of gold 
Thank you no 
If you will permit me I have a request to make 
You're very kind sir 
She will sir gladly 
I think I might manage the accompaniment 
You will won't you dearie 
Yes 
On one condition 
Please 
I apologize for my daughter 
It's wonderful Did Did you write it 
What did the music mean to you 
I don't know 
It is full of emotion But it's not happy 
No it's not happy Why was he unhappy 
What an odd thing for you to say 
Why 
You are so young 
Yes And you also 
What is the music called 
Has it a name 
A kind of name It is called Prelude 
Is this the way you watch Sibyl Mother 
I'd cancel it if my articles hadn't been signed 
I want Sibyl to make a brilliant marriage 
Who is this young dandy What's his name 
Oh I don't know his name but he's rich 
I don't know But I do know his name 
It is Sir Tristan 
He is good I know it 
There is no evil in him Did you see his face 
You're foolish Jim Utterly foolish 
Jim 
You're going away tonight 
Don't let me remember you angry and troubled 
That's better 
Can't you read what people are in their faces 
You think I'm silly when I call him Sir Tristan 
To defend the right to protect all women 
To be true in friendship and faithful in love 
Little yellow bird 
Punctuality is the thief of time Harry says 
Victoria darling how nice 
I love coming to your house Aunt Agatha 
Oh I'm always dropping it 
I imagine it can wait until luncheon is over 
The East End is a very important problem 
A great many I fear 
A delightful theory A dangerous theory 
One of the great secrets of life 
Yes we are overcharged for everything now 
I know what pleasure is 
Harry you're incorrigible 
I don't understand you 
These views are horrifying Lady Agatha 
I ordered them especially for you 
No surely not before the quail Sir Thomas 
Think with the Liberals and eat with the Tories 
Do sit down Sir Thomas 
They're not to be taken seriously 
I'm engaged to be married 
Dorian engaged 
To whom Harry 
To an actress in a cheap vaudeville 
An actress With dyed hair and a painted face 
You don't approve You can't possibly 
I never approve or disapprove of anything 
You think he could be so unfaithful 
Faithfulness is merely laziness 
Number Seven sir 
I've been watching for you 
Lower Euston Road sir Lower Euston Road 
What will your guardian say 
May I ask you a question 
I didn't make any formal proposal Harry 
Women are wonderfully practical 
Which theories 
Your theories about life about pleasure 
When we're good we're not always happy 
She's all that you say but I don't agree 
What wickedness are you contemplating now 
Don't worry Basil I'm immune to his ideas now 
What would you do 
I'm curious to know 
I've always thought your wickedness a pose 
I know better now You're an unmitigated cad 
Will you try my experiment Dorian 
No he hasn't I should love to see it 
Your clock thinks it's time for me to go home 
Clocks can't help being disagreeable 
They think it's their duty 
It's that cat 
I thought I saw its eyes move 
Perhaps you did 
Doesn't it frighten you 
It does a little Listen to this 
You make my creed a barren sham 
You wake foul dreams of sensual life 
What a strange poem Who wrote it 
Why do you look at me so strangely 
Don't leave me now don't go home 
What would you do Sibyl 
Good night then 
Good night 
Do not try to see me 
I have been living in a land of illusions 
Now I shall make an end of dreams 
My real life begins 
Five minutes Miss Vane 
The expression looked somehow different 
It was very strange 
There was no such expression on his face 
For that I would give everything 
I would give my soul for that 
But surely his wish had not been fulfilled 
An illusion brought on by his troubled senses 
A painted canvas could not alter 
It was true The expression had altered 
There was no doubt of it 
It was incredible and yet it was a fact 
Would it teach him to loathe his own soul 
He would give it no reason to reproach him 
He would live purely and nobly 
She could still be his wife 
He implored her forgiveness He blamed himself 
He gave way to the luxury of self reproach 
Dorian let me in I must see you 
Dorian let me in 
You mean about Sibyl Vane 
I've learned to know myself better 
What on earth are you talking about 
I'm not going to break my word to her 
Then you don't know Know what 
Haven't you read the morning papers 
What is it Harry What's happened 
Sibyl Vane is dead 
Did Sibyl 
She died instantaneously 
I can't see why you should blame yourself 
I suppose she foolishly thought she'd lost you 
What is it that has really happened 
Someone has killed herself for love of you 
I wish that I'd had such an experience 
They've become stout and tedious 
It fills one with the terror of eternity 
I don't feel up to it Harry 
It's on the Grand Tier 
You'll see her name on the door 
I hope to see you before half past 9 
I don't want you to miss de Reszke in the duet 
I'm sorry Mr Hallward Mr Gray isn't in 
He's gone to the opera To the opera 
Yes sir Is there any message sir 
No I'll come by in the morning 
Yes I have thank you 
Of course not 
What is past is past 
You call yesterday the past 
I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions 
Something has changed you completely Dorian 
You've come too late 
I suffered immensely Then it passed away 
I cannot repeat an emotion No one can 
It has nothing to do with Harry 
What's wrong with it 
What would you like me to read Basil 
Since you asked me 
The Light of Asia I'm never without it 
The story of Buddha isn't it 
The story of Buddha a good man 
Promise me you'll read it Dorian 
Of course 
I must go now Dorian 
The light was too strong on the portrait 
Surely not 
It's an admirable place for it 
Wait 
You're not serious 
Why shouldn't I look at it 
What on earth is the matter with you 
You told Harry the same thing 
It seemed almost to have a life of its own 
I see you did 
I saw something in it 
Something that seemed to be very curious 
I'm glad of that 
Goodbye Dorian 
Goodbye Basil 
No one ever entered it 
The picture could be safely hidden away there 
He would have to let Victor go and the others 
He must bring new servants into the house 
No one would ever see it 
No one except himself 
He was caught in an evil destiny 
Curious stories were current about him 
He found reasons to justify his actions 
Was insincerity such a terrible thing 
Dorian thought not 
I was close by and came in for a moment 
So is the face that my uncle sketched on it 
He did do it didn't he 
I know his style so well 
Did she sing this song Who is she 
Do tell me about her 
Did you love her very much Dorian 
Yes 
Of course not 
And I've decided what to do about it 
And what have you decided to do about it 
What about David Stone 
No don't tell David 
Of course I have nothing to say about it 
I wouldn't let you marry that devil 
I'll not have you say anything against him 
He hasn't asked you yet 
In front of all those people I suppose 
I'll get him alone It's a big house 
Good night sir Good night David 
What's wrong Dorian 
I don't believe them 
Suppose I were to tell you that they're true 
I will never believe anything evil of you 
What do you know of evil 
I only know there is none in you 
Is that a way of saying you don't love me 
If you like 
It's very beautiful Dorian Thank you 
Would you find David for me 
I must go now 
I see 
May I see them sometime 
Skeletons of inquisitive guests 
I suspected as much 
I want to leave now David 
Of course 
Dorian 
In this fog 
I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square 
It's luck running into you like this 
Won't you miss your train 
I was on my way to the club to look for you 
All I have with me is in this bag 
Come in or the fog will get into the house 
Nothing is serious nowadays 
At least nothing should be 
You make it so much more difficult for me 
I hope it's not about myself 
I'm tired of myself 
It is about yourself and I must say it to you 
I'll only keep you half an hour 
You sound terrifying Basil 
It's for your sake I'm speaking 
I don't want to know them 
They lack novelty 
You must be interested in your own reputation 
You can't dismiss these charges so lightly 
But why are your friendships so fatal to people 
What gentleman will be seen with either of them 
Is that my fault 
What has Gladys to do with this 
Nothing I hope 
And nothing in the future if I can prevent it 
I'm told things it seems impossible to doubt 
Know Do I know you 
To see my soul 
You shall see it yourself tonight 
Why shouldn't you look at it 
It's your own handiwork 
You've chatted enough about corruption 
Now you'll look at it 
I'll show you my soul 
Tell me they aren't true and I'll believe you 
All I want is a plain answer to my question 
You think it's only God who sees the soul 
But this is monstrous 
It's beyond nature beyond reason 
Perhaps you would call it a prayer 
My wish was granted 
But you told me you had destroyed my painting 
I was wrong It has destroyed me 
It has the eyes of a devil 
Each of us has heaven and hell in him 
Do you know how to pray Dorian 
What is it we were taught to say in our boyhood 
The prayer of your pride was answered 
Do you think I haven't tried 
I tell you it's no use 
Isn't there a verse somewhere 
There it is just as she made it 
If she could see it now 
I can still pray Dorian if you can't 
Basil was dead 
And yet what evidence was there against him 
Paris 
What time is it 
Half past 12 sir Half past 12 
Did anyone call this evening 
Mr Hallward sir 
Yes sir Good night sir 
He would come at once 
Days would pass before he could come back 
Perhaps he would refuse to come 
Mr Allen Campbell sir 
This is kind of you Allen 
You said it was a matter of life and death 
Listen to this 
I sent my Soul through the Invisible 
Some letter of that After life to spell: 
And by and by my Soul return'd to me 
And answer'd I Myself am Heav'n and Hell: 
That's quite good don't you think 
He's been dead for 10 hours 
What has that to do with you 
Destroy it so that not a vestige is left 
It was suicide Allen 
What drove him to it 
You won't do this for me 
Allen it was murder I killed him 
You are certain to be caught 
We were friends once Allen I regret that 
Let them 
You refuse 
I entreat you It's useless 
Here it is 
You see the address 
If you don't help me I must send it 
If you don't help me I will send it 
You know what the result will be 
The thing is quite simple Allen 
It would kill her 
I cannot do it 
You have no choice 
You've saved my life 
Why are you so inquisitive Harry 
I came in at half past 12 
Remember your promise Lord Henry 
Or perhaps they will not 
Madame de Farrol 
What's her fourth husband like 
Everyone I know says he's wicked 
I'm always telling him so 
With their ages 
Only slightly edited 
I don't believe it 
Of course I will darling 
This is the only marriage I've ever approved of 
How exciting That is a stunner 
I'm so happy for you 
I congratulate you both 
Not at all 
It's a matter of some urgency 
What are we to do now 
Go on with your own lives peacefully 
It would be I'm going to Selby tomorrow 
Not at all 
Why do you ask 
I've just received a very tragic notice 
Why on earth should Allen Campbell 
Yes 
Perhaps I'm sorry 
Let's be married soon in a fortnight 
A simple wedding with only our closest friends 
A fortnight 
You call that soon 
I'll be at the station 
Allen Campbell 
Would Allen's blood be on the painting now 
Where to sir 
The soul is not an illusion 
It is a terrible reality 
It can be bought and sold and bartered away 
It can be poisoned or made perfect 
What's that you're playing 
It has a name hasn't it 
A kind of name It's called Prelude 
Play something else 
Why you do not like that music 
I heard someone play that piece before 
Eighteen years ago A woman 
Every time I get back to London I look for him 
And when you find him what will you do 
Maybe he's dead already Did you think of that 
I'll keep on looking 
You're not English 
What is English 
There are men and there are women 
This is Sir Tristan Kate darling 
I've asked you not to call me that Adrian 
Why do we never see you 
I have all I need here 
Drink and drugs and no friends 
I've had too many friends 
Oh he's drawing a picture of you sir 
Come and look at it 
What would you like 
A song a poem a painting 
I do all three surpassingly well 
It seems to me there's something lacking 
I have it 
But grim to see 
Is the gallows tree 
Goodbye Adrian 
Goodbye Sir Tristan 
What did you call him 
Sit down 
Four drinks Sir Tristan you said 
He has gone to kill your friend 
Come on Kate 
If it's money you want 
No nothing 
Why are you called Sir Tristan 
It happens to be my name 
How old do you think I am 
Why didn't you murder him 
They could only have hanged you for it 
How old do you think he is 
Twenty two I'd say 
What are you laughing at 
Dorian Gray has looked 22 for the last 20 years 
What did you say his name was 
Not at all 
What are people talking about in London 
They were talking about Basil's disappearance 
What do you think happened to Basil 
He was a fine painter I'm certain of that 
What is your secret 
Perhaps I'll tell you some day 
My good resolutions may have come too late 
Have you had good sport Geoffrey 
Not very good 
Don't shoot it Geoffrey 
Nonsense 
Good heavens I've hit a beater 
Where sir Where is he 
Why on earth don't you keep your men back 
Spoiled my shooting for the day 
Yes he's dead 
He received a full charge in his chest 
Thornton come in 
Was he married Did he have any dependents 
I'll write them any sum you think necessary 
Wasn't he one of your men No sir 
Never saw him before Seems like a sailor 
A sailor 
Where is the body 
In an empty stable at the home farm sir 
Show me his face 
Come in 
What is it Dorian 
I wanted to look at you 
I know darling 
I've felt that way so often about you 
Goodbye Gladys 
Goodbye 
Until half past 8 
Until half past 8 
Go on 
Shall I go on sir 
Well what is it 
What's happened 
Dorian's gone to London Didn't you know 
David passed him on his way from the station 
I thought he'd found out what I've been up to 
What have you been up to David 
What is it you've done David 
I didn't think it was important at first 
It was 4:00 in the morning 
Then he accused him of spying and sacked him 
And did you get in 
Here's the key 
What did you find in the room 
A portrait 
Of whom 
I don't know 
It has a vague family resemblance to Dorian 
He signed it 
Give you my blessing and ask your forgiveness 
Can you describe the portrait in greater detail 
There's a curious cat in it 
Like the one in Dorian's drawing room 
No I don't think so 
I'd be lying if I did 
Like this 
I believe there was How did you know 
Yes Gibson 
He said I must give it to you in person 
You will never see me again 
This is the only good thing I have ever done 
Won't you tell us what it is Gladys 
Perhaps we can help you 
We must go to London at once 
Was it true that one could never change 
Sibyl Vane was dead 
Allen Campbell had shot himself And Basil 
Nothing could alter that 
It was of the future that he must think 
He had spared Gladys 
There was hope for him then 
He would watch the hideousness fade and change 
Heaven forgive me 
Awfully sorry I have to go Had a perfect hand 
Would have beaten the pants off you 
Harry will take you 
Oh thank you 
Watch her carefully 
Don't take your eyes off her 
How are you today Harry 
Fine 
You look a little bilious 
It's the light 
I worry about you dear 
I'll be all right 
Must we dash into Dr Petersen's office 
Love it if I had time 
Would you 
Come in 
You may go now Harry 
I'll be outside 
I hope you feel better today Mary 
Well I don't You will 
I think this whole thing is ridiculous 
What whole thing Mary 
Psychoanalysis 
It bores the pants off me 
Really 
I see 
It's my subconscious putting up a fight 
It doesn't want me cured 
Exactly 
It wants to continue enjoying your disease 
Our job is to make you understand why 
You mean I've been telling you lies 
The usual proportion 
You're right I'm lying like mad 
I hate men I loathe them 
If one of them so much as touches me 
I suddenly pretended I was going to kiss him 
I sank my teeth into his moustache 
Bit it clear off 
You're laughing at me 
You and your drooling science I detest you 
I can't bear you 
You and your nickel's worth of nothing 
Come on Miss Carmichael 
Silly fool 
Letting a creature like that worry me 
Miss Frozen puss 
Oh Dr Fleurot I want to talk to you alone 
I can't stand that woman 
I'll see you later Mary 
Come Miss Carmichael 
Research my eye 
I've watched your work for six months 
Are you making love to me 
I will in a moment 
I'm just clearing the ground first 
and fatal for you as a woman 
Ah but I've got a much better argument 
I'm terribly fond of you 
Why 
It's rather like embracing a textbook 
But why do you do it then 
Because you're not a textbook 
I sense it every time I come near to you 
You sense only your own desires and pulsations 
I assure you mine in no way resemble them 
Stop it I'm mad about you 
I'm afraid I'm boring you 
No 
Your attitudes are very interesting 
I feel exactly like Miss Carmichael 
I'd like to throw a book at you but I won't 
May I borrow this 
Certainly 
Oh and forgive me for my criticism 
My successor will be due any moment 
Thank you very much 
Coming Dr Petersen 
Oh I'm in no mad hurry to welcome Dr Edwardes 
Yes I sort of go with the fixtures 
More than that You are Green Manors 
It seems unfair 
You're very young in the profession 
You haven't learned the basic secret of science 
The old must make way for the new 
Oh that's ridiculous 
You've been like a new man since your vacation 
But having crumbled once I might crumble again 
You were overworked 
A charming diagnosis for a broken down horse 
Yes I I know 
Come in 
Your mail Dr Petersen and Mr Garmes 
Come in Mr Garmes 
You're not leaving today 
I'll see you again 
How do you feel today Mr Garmes 
Somewhat better Doctor 
The thing seems a little less troublesome 
May I do that for you Doctor 
No thank you 
No no I can do this myself very well 
Please sit down I'll be with you in a moment 
So that's the mighty Anthony Edwardes 
He looks a little younger than I expected 
He's only brought one suitcase 
Perhaps he doesn't intend to remain very long 
Leave those daydreams to Dr Murchison 
Gentlemen our new chief Dr Anthony Edwardes 
Dr Fleurot 
How do you do 
How do you do 
I am Dr Graff 
How do you do 
Dr Hanish 
How do you do 
These are your quarters 
They're very festive for an institution 
Dr Edwardes Dr Murchison 
How do you do Dr Murchison 
I've heard a great deal about you sir 
My age hasn't caught up with me yet 
Mine has it seems 
An excellent work 
I hope Green Manors will inspire others as fine 
I'm very grateful 
Will you excuse me 
I spent a half hour with Dr Edwardes 
I must say I was most favorably impressed 
You're familiar with his work 
Mm hmm yes 
I've read all his books 
A very keen unorthodox mind 
He's joining us 
I think you know everyone here Dr Edwardes 
No not yet 
Oh this is Dr Petersen 
How do you do 
Dr Edwardes 
Dr Hanish has been showing me the grounds 
It's a remarkable institution Dr Murchison 
It must be quite beautiful in the summer 
I imagine you're very fond of sports 
Did you show Dr Edwardes the elm grove 
Yes 
Yes indeed 
Oh I'm a great believer in the swimming pool 
There's a perfect spot for it among the elms 
You know 
The bathhouse it should be here 
Forgive me 
They took his appetite away 
I detest that sort of high school talk 
Come in 
Hi Oh excuse me 
It's from Dr Edwardes 
Ohhh love notes already 
The French school of science 
I can see no sense in it myself 
I know Dr Edwardes that I killed my father 
and I'm willing to pay the penalty for 
Come in 
Oh thank you for coming so soon 
Oh it's all right 
I'm very interested in Mr Garmes' case 
Yes I knew you would be 
But I have no guilt complex I know what I know 
I killed my father and I 
No you didn't kill your father 
Oh I'm sorry Doctor You were talking to him 
No no 
Go on 
It usually goes back to their childhood 
What I am thinking isn't true then 
No 
Harry 
He looks agitated 
His conviction is curious 
You described them perfectly in your book 
Yes 
Yes so I did 
Uh would you mind doing me a favor 
Not at all Doctor 
Well I intended typing up my notes 
Oh please 
Excuse me 
Hello Yes Dr Edwardes 
What 
Yes Anthony Edwardes 
Who 
I'm sorry I don't get your name 
Norma Cramer 
Some girl claiming to be 
I hate practical jokes 
Don't you 
Sounds like some ex patient of yours 
They are always full of coy little tricks 
Very likely Come on let's go 
Which it isn't eh 
Of course not 
Sometimes for no reason at all 
That's not the point 
Yes very often 
I beg your pardon 
Here can't get through there like that 
Of course I can 
Really I've been through here many times 
Oh Whoops Hurt 
No not at all Here 
No I'm perfectly all right 
Well I usually go on picnics here alone 
Oh that doesn't sound like much fun 
I haven't gone in for fun as you call it 
Oh isn't this beautiful 
Perfect 
Oh lunch lunch What'll you have 
Ham or liverwurst hmm 
Liverwurst 
Has anybody seen our new chief today 
He has been tied up 
He frisked off with Dr Petersen at noon 
It'll do Constance good to be drooled over 
Poor girl's withering away with science 
Oh please don't get up 
Yes I gave him a sedative 
I'm very sorry I wasn't here 
Instructive 
Allow me Dr Petersen 
Don't run away Do have some coffee 
I would say hot dogs on the state highway 
Would you really 
Your diagnosis is as usual wrong Dr Fleurot 
Not hot dogs 
I must see Mr Garmes 
It's very late 
I I was going to read your new book again 
I would like to discuss it 
I sound rather nervous don't I 
Not at all 
I am amazed at the subterfuge 
I don't want to discuss it at all 
I understand 
And you're not now 
Quite ridiculous 
You're very lovely 
Please don't talk that way 
You'll think I came in to hear that 
I know why you came in 
Why 
Because something has happened to us 
But it doesn't happen like that in a day 
It happens in a moment sometimes 
I felt it this afternoon 
It was like lightning striking 
It strikes rarely 
I don't understand how it happened 
What is it 
It's not you 
It's something about your robe 
My robe 
I don't understand 
Forgive me 
I 
Something struck me 
Your robe 
I mean the dark lines 
You're ill 
No I'll be all right 
Hello Yes Dr Edwardes 
Yes 
Yes 
What 
Where is he 
I'll be there right away 
Mr Garmes He's run amuck 
Well is it bad 
I think so 
He's in surgery 
I'll be right along 
What's the pulse 
One hundred and forty 
It's going down 
Why are the lights out in the corridor 
What do you mean 
It's dark 
That's why he did it 
'Cause the lights are out 
Put 'em on 
The doors Unlock them 
You can't keep people in cells 
Dr Edwardes 
You fools babbling about guilt complexes 
What do you know about them 
He did it 
He told me He killed his father 
Put the lights on quick 
It's dark 
It's dark 
He's in collapse 
He's ill 
He didn't look like a heart case 
Not heart shock of some sort 
We must get 
Probably brought about by exhaustion 
Take him up to his room I'll take care of him 
I'm sorry 
I suppose I made quite an exhibition of myself 
Who brought me down here 
You 
It's rather a mess Going to pieces in surgery 
Who are you 
I remember now 
Edwardes is dead 
I killed him and took his place 
I'm someone else I don't know who 
I killed him 
I have no memory 
And yet the image is there I know it's there 
I exist 
I'm there 
As if he were quite sane Are you afraid of me 
No 
You're ill 
Loss of memory is not a difficult problem 
Yes I know 
Amnesia 
A trick of the mind for remaining sane 
You put the horrible thing behind a closed door 
We have to open that door 
I know what's behind that door: murder 
No 
Will you answer me truthfully and trust me 
I trust you but it's no use I can't think 
I don't know who I am I don't know 
I don't know 
Who telephoned you yesterday 
Telephoned me 
Yes there in the office 
Yes I remember 
What did she say 
She said that she was my office assistant 
She was worried about me hadn't heard 
What else did she say 
You hung up in anger 
I was confused My 
My head ached 
Was that your first doubt 
First doubt 
The first time you became confused as Edwardes 
Did anything else happen before that 
Yes 
I found a cigarette case in my coat 
It frightened me I didn't know why it should 
Here 
They're probably your initials 
You must sleep 
If you trust me 
I trust you 
It's late 
You'd better get some sleep yourself 
I'll be all right 
I'm 
He let me have my vacation when he left on his 
That's why I telephoned 
Show them the picture 
Oh yes 
That's a different man 
He was taking a chance 
You never saw the real Edwardes 
No I never met him 
He didn't impress me as a scientist 
It's obvious now 
You think he may have killed Edwardes 
There's no question of it 
Oh uh this is Dr Petersen 
These gentlemen are from the police 
The police 
What has happened 
Nothing to be alarmed about 
He's disappeared Oh 
He is not in his room 
You left him in his room miss 
Yes 
Did he say anything 
About himself 
About why he broke down 
No 
I I'm used to such surprises in my work 
You suspected something then 
No 
I thought his collapse due to a mental strain 
I made no medical diagnosis 
All except Dr Murchison 
No 
He may be hanging around 
We'll have to go over the grounds first 
I'm sorry this has happened to you Constance 
Don't worry It's not your fault 
They're bound to find him 
I'll keep you informed of the police activities 
Nonsense 
Obviously a case of amnesia 
What do you say Constance 
I I don't know 
I'd say 
Yes you'd say what 
I'm a sentimental ass 
Why not 
It's an obvious suicide 
Why I'm not offended 
I think Dr Fleurot's ideas are quite accurate 
But I'm rather tired Good night 
Good night 
We now resume our regularly scheduled program 
I'm from Pittsburgh 
There's a town for you 
Really can meet people in Pittsburgh 
Friendly 
No thank you 
I 
You don't have to be so snooty about it 
Now you're talkin' 
Do you mind not sitting in my lap in public 
That's enough of that Beat it 
I'll have you know I'm a guest in this hotel 
Who do you think you are 
I'm the house detective Get going 
Aw this town's gettin'worse and worse 
I'm sorry you were being annoyed 
You're not registered here are you 
No 
Lookin' for somebody huh 
Oh now don't be afraid of me 
Schoolteacher or uh librarian 
Which is it 
Schoolteacher 
I thought so 
They always look like they just lost something 
Maybe I can help you 
I don't think so 
Thank you 
Looking for some man I suppose 
Must be a relative 
A husband for instance 
Oh I'm really amazed 
I hit it huh 
But how could you tell 
Well I'm a kind of a psychologist 
You know you gotta be in my line 
Oh no It's just that we quarreled 
That's the usual psychology 
But now you're afraid to face him 
Oh no no 
It's that I 
I don't know what room he's in 
When did he arrive here 
Yesterday morning 
Give me a description of him 
He's He's very tall and and attractive 
I'll go check on him 
Did you find him 
Well I think we got a line 
These are their registration cards 
I figured you might recognize the handwriting 
That's very clever of you 
This is his handwriting 
John Brown huh 
Not much imagination for an alias 
Room 3033 
Oh thank you very much 
Oh I knew you would 
I'm glad to be of service 
Constance 
What did you come for 
You don't owe me anything 
I'm going to do what I want to do 
But you can't You can't help hide a criminal 
I couldn't bear it away from you 
So I had to come I'll get a room on this floor 
Nothing at all Nothing at all 
Try remembering 
Let your mind go back to your childhood 
Was it happy 
Whom did you know in your childhood 
I'm haunted but I 
I can't see by what 
It's no use 
You lived somewhere 
You had a mother You were loved 
You had friends 
Yes 
Probably a wife 
Can you remember her 
No darling 
Thank heaven I can't remember a wife 
I would like to ask you a medical question 
Constance would you mind not prodding me 
It mixes me up 
I 
I can't remember anything 
except that I love you 
A pain that is persistent 
depending on the patient's history 
It's obvious you're a doctor 
Yes 
The eminent Dr X 
No 
What logic 
That it was I who was with Edwardes 
Do you remember that 
No 
Then why do you believe that you were with him 
Because it was hidden by me 
Don't you see that you're imagining all this 
You call yourself names 
You insist without proof that you're a murderer 
You know what that is don't you 
Do all this for a creature without a name 
To run off with a pair of initials 
You were in an accident 
Where was it 
What happened to your hand 
Your hand was burned 
You've had an operation in the last six months 
And skin grafts Third degree burns 
Your hand was burned Where 
It hurts 
Try remembering 
My hand hurts 
Where did it happen 
I can't 
It hurts 
What happened 
It's burning 
My hand's burning 
Try to remember 
Oh my dear are you all right 
I'm all right What happened 
You relived an accident you've been in 
But it's a beginning It really is 
You'll feel better soon 
Who could that be 
Oh I know 
I sent out for the later editions of the papers 
You ordered the afternoon papers didn't you 
Yes 
They just came 
I brought them right up 
Just a minute 
Here you are 
Thank you 
Oh thanks 
My picture's in the paper He recognized me 
We've got to go quick We can't pack 
Listen 
I don't remember 
You will 
Try to repeat what was said then 
Ask for the same tickets 
I'll try 
One 
Philadelphia 
Philadelphia $3 39 including the federal tax 
Thank you 
Washington one way 
You went someplace with Edwardes 
Ask for tickets to that same place 
$8 46 including tax 
Thank you 
What is it 
What do you want sir 
Well please step aside 
I want two tickets 
Where to 
Rome 
Rome 
To where 
Rome 
What Rome 
He means Rome Georgia 
Is anything wrong 
My husband is ill I'm taking him home 
Here you are Two tickets to Rome Georgia 
He looks pretty sick 
I'll call a doctor 
No no 
He'll be all right 
Do you feel better now darling 
Darling 
Pull yourself together You're all right 
When does the train for Rome leave 
I feel better now 
Thank you 
That's all right lady 
Oh he has recovered now 
What's the matter with this train 
The policeman heard us buying the tickets 
Did he act suspicious 
No he was very nice 
We're not going back We're going to Rochester 
Come on 
We'll go over to Grand Central Station 
He was my analyst 
He psychoanalyzed me 
What was wrong with you 
I'm sorry 
I'm a pig 
No I am I keep forgetting you're a patient 
Will you love me just as much when I'm normal 
Oh I'll be insane about you 
I am normal 
We don't want to attract attention 
Everybody's doing it 
You're both going 
Yes 
Pick up what 
Darling I have a confession to make 
Yes I'm listening 
As a doctor you irritate me 
And you're going to like that 
As a scientist yes 
Yes but don't biff too hard 
We have some new facts to work with now 
What facts 
and you were in Rome 
I was never in Rome in my life 
You were either there or going there 
Rome 
Think of Rome 
Maybe Rome Italy 
When did you go to Rome 
What did you do in Rome 
Think 
Think 
Yes I remember 
You were flying 
What happened 
They hit us 
Caught fire 
Uniform burned Bailed out 
What else 
I don't know I I 
You left the army 
Yeah 
I probably deserted it 
I hated it 
I hated killing I can remember that much 
Oh stop it 
Babbling like some phony King Solomon 
If there's anything I hate it's a smug woman 
Darling we're just beginning 
Don't biff too hard yet 
I doubt that 
One psychoanalyst in my hair is enough 
What are you gonna tell him 
That we are on our honeymoon 
I'm sorry but I can't wait any longer 
How do you do 
How do you do 
How do you do 
How's your mother been lately 
Oh she's still complaining about rheumatism 
Did you take the subject up with Hennessy 
Yeah 
And what did Hennessy say to that 
Oh a lot of things 
He made some crack about me being a mama's boy 
Oh pardon me That may be for me 
I gave Headquarters this number 
Hello Yes this is Lieutenant Cooley 
Any new developments 
Well when did you find that out 
No 
Right 
I'll be down later 
Good bye 
Alex 
Who is it please 
Oh my old friend 
Alex 
My dear darling Oh I 
I didn't have time to let you know 
I just arrived 
Imagine I find you here 
Oh I would have come home quicker 
I was giving a lecture at the army hospital 
Are these gentlemen with you 
No I'm here with 
This is Sergeant Gillespie 
What for 
Data 
What is this kind of persecution 
But yesterday you had some kind of theory 
It is the same as playing with a loaded gun 
Do you think this patient might have killed him 
Was Dr Edwardes a great friend of yours 
What are you talking about 
The man was impossible 
Not New York 
In Boston at the psychiatry convention 
I understand you threatened to punch his nose 
If anything turns up we'll let you know 
Good bye ma'am 
Good night sir 
Good night 
The next they will give me is the third degree 
I am so glad to see you 
I got married 
Uh who is married 
Oh Alex My husband John Brown 
I'm glad to meet you officially 
Oh so you are married 
Oh there is nothing so nice as a new marriage 
Yes 
The truth is that we have no hotel room 
All the hotels were so crowded 
What do you want with a hotel 
You will stay right here 
Look how I'm living by myself with a can opener 
My housekeeper is gone to war 
That's wonderful of you Alex 
Ah there is nothing wonderful about me 
But who knows now 
After that they make the best patients 
Good night Alex 
Good night 
You were superb with the police 
Was I 
Alex Oh no 
Things are a little different 
Someone's been here since my time 
No Alex didn't think anything He's sweet 
Do you know this room does look changed 
But it isn't 
What is 
Oh That's what it's called is it 
Did the police disturb you 
Oh no 
One ignores such trifles on a honeymoon 
I take it this is your first honeymoon 
Yes 
I mean it would be if it were 
For what it's worth I 
Oh you're very sweet 
Of course I'm no child 
Oh far from it 
Oh dynamite dumps 
No 
Oh please don't do that 
Why 
It isn't ethical I'm here as your doctor 
No that's also unethical 
I suppose the floor is out 
The patient always sleeps in the bed 
Oh I see you know the rules 
You remember something 
No 
This room reminds you of something 
No 
You're resisting a memory What is in your mind 
I don't know 
Yes you do 
You're resisting it 
Don't start that again 
Don't stand there with that wiseacre look 
I'm sick of your double talk 
You were looking at the bed 
What frightens you 
White lines 
It was white It had dark lines on it 
Why does the color white frighten you 
Why do lines frighten you 
Think of white 
White 
'Cause it frightens me 
I can't look 
Don't run away 
Stand still 
Look at the white spread 
Look at it 
Remember 
Darling 
Oh darling 
You mustn't be frightened 
No you mustn't We are making progress 
We have the word white on our side 
Is that you Mr Brown 
Oh I thought it was you 
I was unable to sleep so I came down to work 
Join me please I'll get another glass 
I'm glad to have company 
When I was a young man I was always saying 
I would be happy 
Now I am saying just the opposite 
This is the secret of old age 
Everything becomes just the opposite 
Old people 
Well we will drink to you 
Alex 
Alex are you all right 
Good morning Yes I am all right 
Thank you 
Oh I fell asleep in the chair 
Yes 
What time is it 
7:00 
You didn't happen 
He didn't go out 
He's over there on the couch 
He's all right He's sleeping fine 
I should have known 
I know practically what is going on 
What happened 
Only what I expected 
I sit here waiting 
If you scream I'm ready 
So he comes downstairs and he's dangerous 
I can see by his face 
This is what I found in his hand last night 
My dear child he's not responsible 
But that's not correct 
Women's talk Bah 
Alex what are you going to do 
Something more for you than for me 
Alex 
I'm calling the police 
No no please 
You are giving me orders My own pupil 
You don't know this man You know only science 
You know his mind but you don't know his heart 
We are speaking of a man 
Oh Oh I see 
Love 
Look at you 
Alex let me tell you about him 
What is there for you to say 
Oh you are right 
I'm not an analyst not even a doctor here 
I'm not talking to you as one 
But believe me 
not what I say but what I feel 
The mind isn't everything 
The heart can see deeper sometimes 
He didn't 
He didn't 
It won't 
You yourself taught me what Freud says 
And how do you know what his real character is 
I know 
I know 
She knows 
This is the way science goes backward 
Who told you what he is 
Freud or a crystal ball 
You are 20 times crazier than him 
She couldn't love him if he was no good 
This is baby talk nothing else 
What do you want I should do 
This could take a year 
Oh no no 
Or a half a year 
and set fire to the house 
Oh my dear girl 
Just a few more days 
You're not hiding a criminal 
All right 
You'll wait 
Go make me coffee 
Oh Alex 
Thank you Thank you very much 
Thank you 
It's uh I'll make you coffee 
with an egg in it 
Who are you 
I'm Dr Brulov 
Bromides 
Who's been feeding me bromides 
I gave you to sleep 
Oh yes 
Rochester 
What's your name 
I don't know 
Constance told you 
Oh nobody told me 
You don't remember your father or mother 
No 
Wife or sweetheart 
No 
Don't fight me I'm going to help you if I can 
I'm going to be your father image 
I want you to look on me like your father 
Trust me lean on me 
This is a shortcut but we haven't much time 
All right Go ahead 
I'm leaning 
Go on 
Talk to me 
There's nothing 
Maybe you dreamt something 
Yeah 
What did you dream 
Hooey 
You are a fine one to talk 
But Freud is hooey This you know 
Wise guy 
You don't like me Papa 
You want I should help you 
or not 
I'm sorry 
So he makes himself sicker trying to forget 
Do you follow this 
Yeah 
Oh how do you feel 
Ah coffee 
Awful 
The patient is going to tell us what he dreamt 
Oh fine 
I'll take notes I'll get my glasses 
Now here's where dreams come in 
Let's see 
We'll find out 
It seemed to be a gambling house 
She came to my table first 
Did you recognize this kissing bug 
Go on 
Well 
He said That makes 21 
I win 
When he turned up his cards they were blank 
I'm sorry about that kissing bit 
Why 
What would that mean 
Never mind 
Not yet 
You are trying to tell yourself something 
What it is we'll figure out later 
There's a lot more to it 
Go on and try to recall the details 
I saw him drop the wheel on the roof 
Suddenly I was running 
Then I heard something beating over my head 
It was a great pair of wings 
I must have escaped I don't remember 
Have some coffee 
Thanks 
Something's happening 
What is it 
Snow 
The light frightened him 
Photophobia 
No it was the snow 
That's the white he's afraid of 
Snow and those tracks 
What tracks 
The sled tracks in the snow 
And my robe It had dark lines on it 
We'll pull the blinds down please 
Dr Edwardes was fond of sports 
Skiing 
Ski tracks in the snow 
That's what those dark lines symbolized for him 
Yes a murder on skis 
Where did Edwardes go for his skiing 
We must find out 
Can you tell us where 
Try 
He has told us of it in his dream 
Let me see your notes 
What can we do for him 
Oh you're not his mama You're an analyst 
The sloping roof 
That means only a mountainside 
And they were skiing 
And the father image 
the bearded man is Dr Edwardes 
That's very simple 
And then a shadow chases him up and down a hill 
That could mean he was escaping from a valley 
No the figure was you 
If you grew wings you would be an angel 
Angel 
Angel Valley 
Do you remember Angel Valley 
No 
It wasn't Angel Valley 
I remember it 
It was a place 
called Gabriel Valley 
What else do you remember now 
Who was the masked figure in your dream 
It was an accident 
Do you remember that 
A skiing accident 
Dr Edwardes went over a snow cliff 
It was no accident 
I can't stand this anymore 
I've had enough of it 
We've got to call the police 
No we have to go to Gabriel Valley 
You've got to go with me 
This is for Cooley when he comes in 
I'll tell him 
At 4:45 
Thank you 
Good bye 
There's a train leaving in an hour 
I know what I have to do 
I can't go on endangering you 
I know about last night 
Nothing happened 
But it will 
I've got to end it before it does 
I love you but I'm not worth loving 
Darling you can help me afterward 
There's no help afterward 
I can cure you 
But you can't undo a murder 
There is none to undo 
I killed him 
Oh stop 
And now you 
Last night I mean 
Don't try to stop me I've got to go 
Guilt guilt 
Yes 
Since childhood 
What 
What was it in your youth 
Enough 
You said you love me 
Look at me then Why am I fighting for you 
Because I love you 
Because I need you 
But I'm nothing 
I want you to come with me to Gabriel Valley 
What good will that do 
I was there 
I killed him 
You mean because it will happen again 
Yes 
And what if I killed him 
Isn't it true that if the episode's repeated 
I'm likely to do the same thing I did before 
Then how do you know I won't kill again 
You believe in me enough to take such a chance 
You ever see her before 
Let's go 
Even very very funny hats 
Put them on 
It was something in my childhood 
Something in my childhood 
I remember now 
I killed my brother 
I didn't kill my brother 
It was an accident 
It was an accident 
Seeing the familiar pictures one at a time 
I went to Columbia Medical School 
Oh and by the way my name's John Ballyntine 
Oh I'm very pleased to meet you 
Another thing My my army record's all right 
I was invalided out 
He was on vacation but I asked him to help me 
And he invited me to go skiing with him 
Where you saved me 
Yes he went over there all right 
I saw him plunge 
So therefore you had not killed him 
Oh no 
It's too late I'm beyond cure 
How does it feel to be a great analyst 
Oh not so bad 
And a great detective 
Wonderful 
And madly adored 
Very wonderful 
You'll look wonderful 
That's a brilliant analysis Doctor 
Oh hello 
Yes yes We know them quite well 
How did you find us 
Well no thanks to your friend Dr Brulov 
We made a few inquiries at the railroad station 
You left a trail a mile wide 
Well you arrived just in the nick of time 
I believe that's the usual expression 
We found the body of Dr Edwardes 
You remembered the spot very well 
I'm afraid a bullet was found in the body 
T T That's impossible 
It was in his back 
The case is one of murder 
We shall have to detain you sir 
No 
No you mustn't say you killed him darling 
He was in a state of great mental distress 
But you can't put him away You can't 
It'll destroy his mind 
Don't you understand 
Good bye my dear 
We won't give up hope 
I'm going to fight and fight and get you free 
The evidence was definite 
We can't remove it by wishing or crying 
He trusted me 
I led him into a trap I convicted him 
Is that real enough for you 
There is no one to blame 
The case was a little deeper than you figured 
It is over for both of you 
It's not over 
You will have other cases It's not over 
It never will be 
Don't ask me to stop I can't 
I can't 
Oh I'm I'm sorry 
I I 
It is very sad to love and lose somebody 
And you will work hard 
There is lots of happiness in working hard 
Maybe the most 
I will write to you 
Oh Alex you're very good 
Very good 
You have just time 
Oh thank you 
I'm always late always forgetting 
A brilliant man 
I should have gone to the station with him 
You're too tired 
I know that feeling of exhaustion only too well 
One must humor it or it explodes 
I shall try to help you in every way 
You will take care of yourself 
Yes 
And try to forget things better forgotten 
Thank you 
I knew Edwardes only slightly 
I never really liked him 
But he was a good man in a way I suppose 
Well good night Constance 
I hope you feel rested in the morning 
I knew Edwardes only slightly 
I never liked him very well 
I knew Edwardes only slightly 
I knew Edwardes slightly 
Knew Edwardes 
Knew Edwardes slightly 
Knew Edwardes 
Knew 
Knew 
Knew 
Come in 
I want to talk to you Dr Murchison 
It's rather late I do need rest Constance 
I must talk to you 
Nocturnal conferences are bad for the nerves 
Is it something about your work 
Yes 
Can't it wait till morning 
It can't wait 
Well do sit down 
Now what's your problem 
It is a dream one of my patients reported 
May I ask who the patient is 
The patient is John Ballyntine 
I fancied that 
What did he dream 
He dreamt he was in a gambling house 
Blank cards 
That's what I had in mind Dr Murchison 
Do go on 
Oh The guards at Green Manors 
That makes it 21 
The seven of clubs might mean a club 
Yes with the word 21 in it 
I've heard of it 
This is my place I'm going to fix you 
In fact 
was myself 
It seemed that way to me 
Yes 
Not yet 
Was there any more to the dream 
Yes 
He dropped the wheel 
The symbolism of the small wheel escapes me 
It was a revolver 
That started your agile young mind going 
You were having a breakdown 
You accused him of stealing your job 
You threatened to kill him 
You followed him there 
and shot him from behind a tree 
That's enough Your story is ridiculous 
There'll be no dreams for the police 
There will be no dreams necessary for this case 
I see 
Congratulate you 
I hadn't planned to 
But you're here You're not leaving 
You're thinking that now Dr Murchison 
If you shoot now it is cold deliberate murder 
And remember what I say 
All right 
Good bye 
Good luck Good bye

Grandad is happy Let's go to bed 
Good night

Sure because you're a woman 
And women can't be brave

What's the matter 
I had a fight with my sister 
Again 
She wants to leave

Like when we first talked remember 
Who do you think you are King of the Universe 
I didn't like you at all 
2 years have gone by 
How far it seems how different everything is 
Though we were already at war 
Instead 
When will it be over 
There are times when I can't take any more 
It seems like we'll never get out of this hell 
You'll see I know these things 
Giorgio knows how to get it done 
He knows how to speak well 
But I believe it's like that 
we're in the right understand 
Yes Francesco 
And above all our children will know it 
Marcello and him the one we're waiting on 
You promise 
Hello 
Oh it's you ma'am 
We haven't seen him 
But he hasn't phoned or sent anyone 
Nanina tell me the truth Do you know anything 
I don't know ma'am I swear 
We hope not 
She wants to turn us all in to the cops

Thank you Go on 
Let's go 
Did they hurt you Don Pietro

It's my fault They must have followed me 
I'd say the opposite 
I think they've been spying on me for some time 
You didn't have to come with me 
Quiet 
The walls have ears 
So what for what we have to say 
Isn't that right Don Pietro 
Yes We've nothing to say 
Did you hear them 
That's us too We'll be screaming like that 
Stay calm 
We found this in the priest's bedroom 
Yes top to bottom 
Did you seen anyone

I'm sure they wouldn't dare talk 
You're wrong they will talk 
Take all this away 
You're not afraid 
Yes very but at the same time calm 
You're all crazy 
Listen I know

Human lives depend on your silence

Then listen to me carefully: 
I'll explain why; 
Your words impress me deeply 
At last you understand 
Kramer 
Yes Major 
Take down his statement 
Yes but there's a problem 
What 
It's part of our discipline 
I'm not interested in your discipline 
But someone above you and I is interested 
Then convince your friend to talk 
I'll tell you now who this man is: 
a subversive an atheist 
Not thinking of giving me a sermon I suppose 
It's not my intention 
Listen I don't have time to waste 
Have you decided to talk 
Don't you worry he'll talk 
I don't think he will talk You believe so 
He won't talk 
I will pray for him 
Keep me informed 
Come in 
Major the traitors have been hung 
Idiot 
Guess who for a change 
Got much work tonight 
Not much but interesting Really 
Concerning what 
And if he doesn't talk Nonsense 
But if he keeps quiet 
Men are divided in this way 
25 years ago I led firing squads in France 
You're drunk Hartmann Yes I'm drunk

Killing 
We've covered Europe in corpses

No hope 
I forbid you 
Have you forgotten you are a German officer 
Has he talked yet No Major 
Wendel says he's never seen such stubborness 
He's reached total insensibility 
What do we do Major 
Well Wendel 
Practically impossible Major 
We have to wait till he recovers a little 
Impossible There's no time 
Maybe psychological methods Major 
You're mad He's got to talk 
The injection 
You're a Communist 
I'm offering to settle the problem; 
I told you he wouldn't talk so easily 
Got a cigarette 
The priest quick 
Look at that Are you satisfied

Is that love for your 'brother in Christ' 
It's over It's over 
Bastards Bastards 
My God what have I said 
Forgive me Lord forgive me 
Get out of here Bring the priest 
Quick 
Stupid Italians 
That priest has ruined all my plans 
I told you it wouldn't be so simple 
You're always right

Will you come in please sir 
I'll tell the general you're here 
Thank you 
Morning 
You're not very tall are you 
Well I tried to be 
Not bad looking though you probably know it 
Thank you 
What's your name 
Reilly Doghouse Reilly 
That's a funny kind of name 
You think so 
What are you 
No I'm a shamus 
What's that 
A private detective 
You're making fun of me 
You're cute 
The general will see you now sir 
Who's that 
Miss Carmen Sternwood 
You ought to wean her 
She's old enough 
This is Mr Marlowe general 
How do you do sir 
Sit down sir 
Thank you 
Brandy Norris 
How do you like your brandy sir 
In a glass 
I used to like mine with champagne 
Come come man 
Pour a decent one 
I like to see people drink 
That'll do Norris 
You may take off your coat sir 
Thank you 
You may smoke too 
I can still enjoy the smell of it 
Crippled paralyzed in both legs 
The orchids are an excuse for the heat 
Do you like orchids 
Not particularly 
Nasty things 
Their flesh is too much like the flesh of men 
Tell me about yourself 
There isn't much to tell 
I'm 38 
I went to college 
I worked for the district attorney's office 
I was fired for insubordination 
I seem to rate pretty high on that 
I always did myself 
What do you know about my family 
Well you're a widower a millionaire 
You have two daughters 
Both living with you and both 
Go on sir 
Both pretty and both pretty wild 
Why'd you want to see me 
I'm being blackmailed again 
Again 
What does that mean 
Who handled it 
Shawn Regan 
Shawn has left me 
I thought I hadn't seen him lately 
A month ago without a word 
I had no claim on him 
I was only his employer 
That at least he'd have said goodbye 
That's what hurt 
You knew him too 
My respects to you sir 
But you knew that 
No I didn't 
I know he was a good man at whatever he did 
My friend 
My son almost 
Well enough of that 
Here 
Mr Arthur Gwynn Geiger Rare Books 
Read the other side 
Respectfully 
These her signatures 
Who's Arthur Geiger 
I haven't the faintest idea 
Did you ask her 
No and I don't intend to 
I met her in the hall and she did that to me 
Well 
Your other daughter Mrs Rutledge 
She mixed up in this 
They alike 
Vivian is spoiled exacting smart and ruthless 
Well 
Pay him 
Why 
She signed these notes didn't she 
Who's this Joe Brody you paid the $5000 to 
I can't recall 
My butler Norris would know 
I think he called himself a gambler 
Geiger says these are gambling debts 
They may be 
Think they are 
You want me to take this Geiger off your back 
Is that right 
Want to know anything 
I just want to get rid of him 
Might cost you a little 
Thanks for the drink 
I enjoyed your drink as much as you did sir 
You'll hear from me 
Good luck 
Instructed you how 
I see sir 
I forget that you're a detective 
By the way he rang his bell sir 
You write his checks 
I have that privilege 
Good for you 
How did she know I was here 
She saw you through the window 
I was obliged to tell her who you were 
I don't know as I like that 
Are you attempting to tell me my duties sir 
Just having fun trying to guess what they are 
This way sir 
Go right in Say you're expected 
Thanks 
You wanted to see me 
So you're a private detective 
You're a mess aren't you 
I'm not very tall either 
I doubt if even that would help 
It shouldn't be too tough 
I'd have thought it took a little effort 
Not too much 
What will your first step be 
The usual one 
There's a usual one 
Sure there is 
You must've read one on being a comedian 
Hear what I said about the drink 
I'm serious My father's 
I said your father 
Help yourself 
Look Mr Marlowe my father's not well 
That's the way I was going to handle it 
I see No professional secrets 
I thought you wanted a drink 
I changed my mind 
Then what 
How'd you like Dad 
I liked him 
He liked Shawn 
Shawn Regan 
I suppose you know who he is 
You don't have to play poker with me 
Doesn't Dad want to find him 
Do you 
Of course 
It wasn't right for him to go off like that 
Broke Dad's heart although he won't say much 
Or did he 
Why don't you ask him 
I don't see what there is to be cagey about 
I don't like your manners 
I'm not crazy about yours 
I didn't ask to see you 
But don't waste your time cross examining me 
People don't talk to me like that 
I usually get away with it too 
How nice for you 
Just what is it you're afraid of 
Dad didn't see you about Shawn did he 
Didn't he 
Could you find him if Dad wanted you to 
Maybe 
When did he go 
About a month back 
Drove off one afternoon without saying a word 
They 
Who's they 
Dad didn't tell you 
That's what you wanted me to say 
I'm sure I don't care what you say Mr Marlowe 
Then I'm wasting your time 
Goodbye Mrs Rutledge 
Oh Norris 
You made a mistake 
Mrs Rutledge didn't want to see me 
I'm sorry sir 
I make many mistakes 
Did you find what you wanted 
Yes thanks 
I collect blondes in bottles too 
Can I be of any assistance 
Would you happen to have a Ben Hur 1860 
A what 
Do you have a Ben Hur 1860 
A first edition 
No no the third the third 
The one with the erratum on page 116 
I'm afraid not 
How about a Chevalier Audubon 1840 full set 
Not at the moment 
You do sell books 
What do those look like 
Grapefruit 
Well they look like books 
Maybe I'd better see Mr Geiger 
He's not in just now 
That's a pity because 
I said Mr Geiger is not in 
I heard you 
You needn't yell at me 
The word is ceramics 
And they ain't Argentine They're Egyptian 
You did sell a book once didn't you 
Do so 
Thank you 
Is there something I can do for you 
Would you do me a small favor 
It depends on the favor 
You know Geiger's bookstore 
I think I may have passed it 
You know Geiger by sight 
What's he look like 
Wouldn't it be easier to go and ask to see him 
I've already done that 
Know anything about rare books 
You could try me 
Or a Chevalier Audubon 1840 
Nobody would 
There isn't one 
I see 
You begin to interest me vaguely 
I'm a private dick on a case 
You'd make a good cop 
Thanks 
Going to wait for him to come out 
They don't close for another hour or so 
And it's raining pretty hard 
I got my car and 
That's right It is isn't it 
I'd a lot rather get wet in here 
Well 
Tell me more about this business 
There isn't much to tell 
What's the matter 
I'm just wondering if you have to 
Not necessarily 
Little things like that make an 
Hello 
Who's the man getting out 
Geiger's shadow 
Thanks 
If you ever want to buy a book 
A Ben Hur 1860 
With duplications 
So long 
So long pal 
You're cute 
And you're higher than a kite 
Come on wake up 
I know you Doghouse Reilly 
You're cute 
What do you know about this 
Mr Geiger Here on the floor 
He's cute too 
You got a dead man at your feet 
How did it happen 
You talk a lot Reilly 
Come on 
Lie down there and be quiet 
All right Reilly 
Come on we're going 
Good evening sir 
Good evening Norris 
I'd like to see General Sternwood 
He's asleep 
What about Mrs Rutledge 
Is she 
Good evening Mrs Rutledge 
I've got your sister outside 
She's not walking very well 
Are you sure 
Yes she'll be all right in the morning 
Did you do this 
Including being insolent 
Where did you find her 
I didn't find her 
Then how 
That bad 
Just what did happen 
You're fond of your sister 
Yes I am 
Do anything for her wouldn't you 
Anything 
Then drop this 
I still think I should know 
Don't even ask her 
She never remembers anyway 
Just what did she forget about Shawn Regan 
What'd she tell you 
Not as much as you just did 
Take it easy 
You go too far Marlowe 
Good night Mrs Rutledge 
Thanks Norris 
I've put her car away 
If anybody asks she's been in all evening 
Forget about my being here 
I understand 
May I call a cab 
It'd be better if you didn't 
Good night 
Hello Bernie Come in 
Hello Phil 
Don't you ever sleep 
What you been doing 
Just sitting around 
All evening 
What is it 
Does it have to be something 
Working on cipher huh 
Just fooling around 
Thanks to you 
Done anything for them yet 
I started today 
Then the rain came 
And there's a guy in it 
Could it be Regan 
Who 
Shawn Regan 
What would he be doing down there 
What would anybody be doing down there 
That's what I'm going to Lido to find out 
Want to come 
Yeah I do 
How's the weather 
Clearing up 
What time did that call come in 
About 15 minutes ago 
What kind of car you say it was 
Packard 
Hello Bernie 
Hi Ed 
You got him out 
Who is he 
What's the story 
You can see it from here 
There's where he went through the railing 
The rain stopped here about 9 p m 
The broken rails are dry inside 
That would put it about 9:30 
Let's have it doc 
What made the bruise 
Steering wheel 
Whatever it was it was covered 
Blackjack 
Could be 
Bernie funny thing 
The hand throttle is set halfway down 
Thanks Jim 
So long doc 
All right boys Take him away 
Could be drunk or a suicide 
Yeah but it isn't 
You know anything about Owen Taylor 
Better tell me what you're working on 
They told me blackmail 
Who were they after 
Carmen 
This doesn't look like the way you'd handle it 
You know I got a feeling that 
Me 
I didn't do this 
What were you going to say Phil 
Okay Let's go home 
Good morning 
Who's he 
A French writer 
Come into my boudoir 
You don't put on a front 
Not much money in this work if you're honest 
Are you honest 
We're going to start that again 
I'm sorry Also about yesterday 
Perhaps I was rude 
We were both rude 
You want to see me about Taylor 
So you know about that 
Poor Owen 
He knew Owen Taylor wanted to marry your sister 
But I didn't come here about Owen 
Not without his permission 
You can't even tell me if it was about Carmen 
Eight thirty five 
That's right 
She takes a nice picture 
They want $5000 for the negative and prints 
The demand came how 
A woman telephoned me after it was delivered 
What else 
There has to be something else 
This thing isn't worth $5000 to anybody 
They think it is 
Why 
What kind of a jam 
I don't know 
You know where this picture was taken 
I haven't the slightest idea 
Or when 
Talk to Carmen about it 
She was asleep when I left 
Figure out a story 
Norris fixed that 
How 
She was in all evening 
Police checked when they called about Owen 
Go ahead and scratch 
What was Owen doing with your car last night 
Nobody knows He took it without permission 
Why 
You think 
That he knew about this picture 
I don't rule him out 
That's why I came to you 
There's five fingers on a glove 
Why didn't you go to the police 
May I use your phone Mr Marlowe 
Police headquarters please 
Hello this is Mrs 
Hello What do you want please 
What 
I called you 
Say who is this 
Sergeant Reilly 
Wait a minute You'd better talk to my mother 
Hello Who's this 
The police 
This isn't a police station 
If you know it why did 
Look this is not a police station 
What was that you said 
My father should hear this 
Hello Who is this 
Yeah but she just told you that 
You're the police 
He's the police 
Well that's different What can I do for you 
I can do what 
Where 
Oh no 
I hope the sergeant never traces that call 
You like to play games don't you 
Why did you stop me phoning 
Because I'm working for your father 
I prefer the second reason 
Can you get it 
I think so 
Where from your father 
I'd rather not 
Where would you get it 
Well from Eddie Mars 
The gambler 
That explains why you haven't got $5000 in cash 
I like gambling 
So do I 
How do you know he'll give it to you 
I can get the money 
I've been a good customer of Eddie Mars 
Another reason: 
You see Shawn Regan ran off with Eddie's wife 
That doesn't interest you 
It might make it easier for me to find him 
That is if I were looking for him 
Is Regan mixed up in this 
Tell you what 
What you're trying to find out 
You know it's a funny thing 
You're trying to find out why I was hired 
And I'm trying to find out why you 
You could go on forever couldn't you 
It'll give us something to talk about next time 
Among other things 
Oh Mrs Rutledge 
That call how'd you leave it 
She's to call me at 6 p m with instructions 
Phone me when you've heard from her 
Goodbye Mr Marlowe 
Well it wasn't intentional 
Try it sometime 
I'm back again Remember me 
I'm afraid I 
Do you remember me now 
Now see here 
No he isn't You might come back tomorrow 
Drop the veil I'm in the business myself 
Is he sick 
I could go to his house 
Say Agnes you 
Come on Carol 
Hurry up will you 
Perhaps 
His name's Lundgren isn't it 
What do you want 
Who's the other guy 
You'd better come tomorrow 
In the morning 
Early 
Because it looks like you're moving today 
All right driver Let's go 
Around the corner then take it easy 
Where are we going 
Follow a car A tail job 
I'm your girl bud 
It wouldn't be bad 
Here you are sugar Buy yourself a cigar 
Day and night 
Night's better I work during the day 
What are you 
Remember me 
I'm Doghouse Reilly 
The man that didn't grow very tall 
Come on I've got a key 
Where'd you leave your car 
Around in back 
Looking for something 
How much do you remember about last night 
Remember what 
I was sick last night I was home 
Before you went home In that chair there 
You remember all right 
Quit your stalling and stop biting your thumb 
Are you the one who was here 
How much do you remember 
Are you the police 
No I'm a friend of your father's 
Who killed Geiger 
Who else knows about it 
What that he's dead 
I don't know 
Not the cops or they'd be camping here 
Was it Joe Brody 
Joe Brody 
Who's he 
Did Brody kill him 
Kill who 
Yes Joe did it 
He did 
Why 
I don't know 
But you're ready to tell the police he did it 
That is if we can get the photograph 
You mean 
I've got to go home now 
I wouldn't say anything about anything 
Just leave it to Reilly 
Your name isn't Reilly 
Mr Geiger around 
We don't know where he is 
We found the door open and just stepped in 
Friends of his 
Business 
We dropped in for a book 
Any message if he comes back 
No I don't think so We won't bother you 
Just a minute 
The girl can go 
I'd like to talk to you 
Suppose I don't want to talk to you 
I've got two boys out in the car 
It's like that eh 
Run along angel 
Your story sounds wrong 
That's too bad Got a better one 
Maybe I can find one 
Blood Quite a lot of blood 
Is that so 
Do you mind 
No I'm used to it 
I think we'll let the police in on this 
We'll have some law 
Yeah Why not 
Who are you soldier 
Marlowe I'm a private detective 
Who's the girl 
A client 
Convenient the door being open 
Wasn't it 
How'd you have a key 
That your business 
Could be 
I could make yours mine 
You wouldn't like it The pay's too small 
All right I own this house Geiger's my tenant 
Now what do you think of it 
You know some nice people 
I take them as they come 
Got any good ideas 
One or two Somebody gunned Geiger 
Or somebody got gunned by Geiger who ran away 
I don't get it I don't get your game 
Don't you Mr Mars 
Wondered why you didn't ask me who I was 
What racket 
You talk too much 
You really got those boys outside 
Open the door 
Open it yourself I already got a client 
It's all right Just proving something 
While you're here look him over 
Pardon me 
Who is he 
Philip Marlowe Hobart Arms Franklin Street 
Special license deputy badge and all 
All right outside 
A shamus 
The man said Outside 
He said that That's what the man said 
He kills me 
Is he any good 
Who 
Sidney 
He's company for Pete 
All right talk 
Not to you I already got a client 
I might make it worth your while 
I might make it worth yours 
I could make you talk 
It's been tried 
And 
Why don't you call the cops 
I think you'd better get out of here 
By the way how's Mrs Mars these days 
You take chances Marlowe 
I get paid to 
I'm sorry I have nothing to tell you 
She didn't call 
No she didn't 
Well did you get the money in case she does 
All right I'll stay right here until you call 
Geiger 
You said what 
I don't know anybody by that name 
You're Joe Brody 
So what 
So you're Joe Brody 
And you don't know Geiger That's very funny 
Now 
All right If you think you got something 
You alone Joe 
Except for this 
Put it down Joe 
The other guy was Eddie Mars 
You ever hear of him 
What would I be to Eddie Mars 
I don't know if you don't 
Look don't get me wrong I'm not a tough guy 
Just careful 
What's your story 
Why don't you ask your friend to come out 
She must get tired of holding her breath 
Come on out Agnes 
Hello sugar 
I knew you were trouble I told Joe 
Ask Mrs Rutledge to come out too 
What did you come for 
Why'd you lie to me 
I don't need you 
Keep out of it 
I don't want you here Will you get out 
You bet I'm wondering and I'll find out 
Sit down 
Stop waving that gun 
Don't argue with the man 
You're ruining things 
I'm not If you'd 
Say look 
What are you up here for 
What cops 
Look Joe you shot Geiger 
I didn't know 
The cops don't yet 
But he wasn't alone when you shot him 
But you had nerve enough to take the film 
You're crazy 
Shut up 
You think you've got me 
Positive 
How come 
You mean Carmen She'd say anything 
So you have got that picture 
I guess you think I'm dumb 
Just average for a grafter 
Or having the picture Make sense 
Who are you 
A guy who gets paid to do people's laundry 
All I'll get out of it is that picture 
How about some dough 
I'm down to nickels 
Not from my client Get the picture Joe 
Stay right there 
Here Watch him 
Take it easy 
I want my picture 
Now 
I want my picture 
You shot Geiger 
Hold it 
Sit down sugar Now where were we 
Oh yes You were just about to get something 
There better not be any more prints 
There won't be 
Can I have my picture now 
Can I have my gun 
Later 
You're cute I like you 
You better take her home 
I suppose I should thank you 
No just don't lie to me next time 
Come on Carmen 
Hold it Joe 
You got off easy Joe 
What's the matter sugar 
He gives me a pain 
Goes for me too 
You got your pictures Get out 
Where's the pain 
In my 
Get out 
Not yet We got a few things to straighten out 
I told you to get out 
What difference does it make now 
Why'd you put the bee on Mrs Rutledge 
How well do you know her 
We'll pass that 
That's a little weak but we'll pass that too 
Say Joe how'd you get that picture 
You got what you came for and you got it cheap 
I don't know anything about it Do I Agnes 
But you just gave it to me 
A half smart guy 
That's what I always draw 
Did I hurt you much 
You and every other man 
Where'd you get that picture 
It fell out of somebody's pocket 
Got an alibi for last night 
I was here with Agnes 
That's a great witness 
A couple of murders 
Where were you 
Why 
To get something on him 
Look at me while you're talking 
It was raining hard and I was in my car 
Who else was back there 
Nobody 
Know where that Packard is now 
It's in the sheriff's garage 
There was a dead man in it 
You can't pin that on me 
I can try 
Sit down Joe 
He didn't like the games Geiger was playing 
All right you're right 
I followed him 
So I came up and played copper 
Well I didn't 
Somebody did 
You wanted time to take over 
You can't prove I did it 
I don't particularly want to 
Maybe you and I can make a little deal 
Go ahead 
Maybe she's back 
If she is she hasn't got her gun 
You got a match bud 
What'll it be kid 
Me or the cops 
What do you want 
Sit in that car back of the wheel 
You drive 
By the way Carol you shot the wrong guy 
Brody didn't kill Geiger 
All right let's go 
You got a key 
Let's go in 
Who said I got a key 
All right come on 
Maybe you need this 
Hello 
Hello Bernie 
Is this who I think it is 
It's Marlowe 
How are you fixed for red points 
I haven't got any 
Who has 
What are you talking about 
That's police business 
I know it's police business 
I'll be right out 
I'll be waiting for you 
What did you hide Geiger's body for 
Do you admit shooting Brody 
Take a jump Jack 
He doesn't have to admit it 
Here's his gun 
I'm late I'm sorry 
How are you today 
Better than last night 
I could agree on that 
Hello Max 
Good afternoon 
Got a table for us 
Certainly madam 
This way please 
I'll have a Scotch Mist 
A scotch and plain water 
How'd you happen to pick out this place 
Maybe I wanted to hold your hand 
That can be arranged 
Why'd you want to see me 
So was I 
He hopes you didn't involve yourself too deeply 
You tell him it was no fault of yours 
No 
He asked me to give you a check 
I don't need any money yet 
He considers the case closed 
It is isn't it 
As far as Geiger is concerned yes 
Then it's completely closed 
I hope this is satisfactory 
Five hundred 
Tell me what do you do when you're not working 
Play the horses fool around 
No women 
Could that be stretched to include me 
I like you 
I told you that before 
I liked hearing you say it 
But you didn't do much about it 
Neither did you 
Speaking of horses I like to play them myself 
But I like to see them work out a little first 
Find out mine 
I think so 
Go ahead 
I'd say you don't like to be rated 
You don't like to be rated yourself 
I haven't met anyone yet that could do it 
Any suggestions 
A lot depends on who's in the saddle 
Go ahead Marlowe I like the way you work 
There's one thing I can't figure out 
What makes me run 
I'll give you a little hint 
Sugar won't work 
It's been tried 
What did you try it on me for 
Who told you to sugar me off this case 
Was it Eddie Mars 
All right don't answer me 
No 
He's not well 
I used my own judgment 
Are you sure 
I know it hasn't worked so well up till now 
What's Eddie Mars got to do with this case 
Nothing 
He runs a gambling house 
I play horses I play the wheel 
You're playing something else too 
Never mind talking Let me do it 
Who doesn't 
I don't believe 
Then why does it bother you so much 
What's Eddie Mars got on you 
Come now angel Stop shaking 
I don't wanna hurt you I'm trying to help you 
You better run along 
Pardon me 
We still can 
So long Marlowe 
Waiter

For her dear old hennaed curls 
And her tears flowed like wine 
She's a real sad tomato 
She's a busted valentine 
Knows her mama done told her 
That a man is darned unkind 
She was a sob sob sister 
Lyin' on a pillow 
Weepin' like a willow 
My oh my How that baby could cry 
And her tears flowed like wine 
Yes her tears flowed like wine 
Hello boys

Hello Eddie 
Hello Marlowe 
Glad you came 
Ever been here before

I like the way you've handled this whole thing 
You and I could get along 
I like to pay my bills as I go 
How much do I owe you 
For what 
Still careful huh 
I want some information about Shawn Regan 
You get around 
My boys do 
Where is he 
I haven't any idea 
You didn't bump him off did you 
No You think I did 
I came here to ask you

All right I'm kidding 
You didn't do it I used to know Regan 
I wasn't then Maybe I just got curious 
That I'm sure of 
It's finished then 
The general thinks like you do 
He paid me off today 
I'm sorry to hear that 
She's out there now 
I know I heard her 
She's not very popular here 
If she wins she takes my money home 
Don't you get it back next time 
She spends it somewhere else 
Oh she goes on the cuff 
I'd keep her out of here then 
I took the trip for nothing 
Sorry I can't help you 
No thanks 
I'll go out with the other suckers 
Maybe someday I can do you a real favor 
Maybe There's one thing that puzzles me 
Sorry 
Tailing me in a gray Plymouth coupe 
No Why should I 
I don't like you that well 
So long Eddie 
Mr Marlowe 
Mr Marlowe 
Mrs Rut 
Mrs Rut 
You better take it 
She's at the center table 
Thank you both 
Mr Marlowe 
Mrs Rutle 
Mrs Rutledge wants to see me 
How did you know 
He told me 
She sure is picking them tonight 
She won eight bets in a row 
I didn't hear him tell you anything 
He didn't 
What kind of game is this 
Spin the wheel 
I want another play 
It's your money 
Don't you want it back 
I sent for Mr Mars 
Look lady you know 
Do you want to cover it 
Hello Marlowe 
Hello 
The lady 
Something the matter Mrs Rutledge 
I'd like one more play All this on the red 
Cover her bet in even thousands 
Wish me luck Marlowe 
You wanted to see me 
Sure 
Are you ready lady 
Yeah I'm ready 
So am I 
Number five red 
You did all right 
Good night 
This is a gun lady I want that money 
Yell and I'll cut you in half 
Give me that bag 
Hello pal 
Easy 
Somebody's always giving me guns 
You can turn around now 
I don't like people who play games 
Tell your boss when you wake up 
I'm glad I asked you to take me home 
So am I 
Shall we go now 
Why are you trembling 
I'm not used to being hijacked 
Give me a little time 
Hijacked 
Is that what it was 
What else 
You're still shaking 
What's the matter 
You weren't worried about me 
Afraid I'd get hurt 
When did you begin to feel that way about me 
Why are we stopping 
To settle something 
You've already been paid haven't you 
Yeah by you 
Are you after more money 
I guess you've got a right to ask 
No I've already been well paid 
I've got another reason 
You like my father don't you 
Why don't you stop 
I wish you'd show it 
That should be awful easy 
I like that I'd like more 
That's even better 
All right 
So that's the way it is 
That's the way it is 
Kissing you is all right 
I'd like to do more of it 
I want to find out what Eddie has on you 
Say that again 
I'll say it till I find out 
You two staged an act 
You're shaking again 
Take me home 
Sure I will 
But first open that bag 
Take me home 
All right but that's as far as I'll carry you 
From now on you can take care of yourself 
I'm trying to think of something appropriate 
How'd you get in here 
Bet you can't guess 
I'll bet I can 
You came in through the keyhole like Peter Pan 
Who's he 
A guy I used to know around a poolroom 
You're cute 
I'm getting cuter every minute 
How did you get in 
I told him you said to come up and wait 
I want 
See I remembered 
What do you remember about Shawn Regan 
I didn't like him 
Yeah why 
Treated me like a baby all the time 
How's Eddie Mars treat you 
I don't know him 
You sure 
You know who he is don't you 
He's always calling Vivian up 
Why Is he cute 
I think you're telling the truth for a change 
Is he as cute as you are 
Nobody is 
I've had a long day 
You'd better be going 
Come on Carmen 
I don't want to 
You can't 
Shut up 
Hello Phil 
Hello Bernie 
What's up 
I want to see you down here right away 
I just woke up I haven't had breakfast 
It's 2:00 
All right I'll be there 
What's up 
I got some orders for you 
Who says so 
The DA 
He must have changed his mind 
Who changed it for him 
General Sternwood 
Personally 
All right 
He talked to the daughter Mrs Rutledge 
Any reason given 
Not that I know of 
Just to keep his hand in 
I'm just supposed to tell you to lay off 
I know you just work here 
Put yourself in my shoes for a minute 
The other is not so wonderful 
As a result somebody gets something on her 
The father hires me to pay off 
Before I get to the guy he's killed 
Who's somebody 
I think it's Eddie Mars 
Why 
Last night the two of them 
What does the general think about all this 
You still want me to lay off 
Thanks Bernie 
I'm going out to get breakfast 
You want a cup of coffee 
I can't afford to be seen with you 
So long Bernie 
Sternwood residence 
Hello Norris 
This is Marlowe 
Yes Mr Marlowe I 
I'd like to come out and see General Sternwood 
I don't think it would be possible tonight 
Why not 
I've been trying to call you 
Mrs Rutledge is very anxious to talk to you 
If you'll wait just a minute I'll put her on 
Hey sugar you got a match 
Sure thing 
Hello Marlowe 
Thanks 
Hello Mrs Rutledge 
What's that 
You've found Shawn 
Yes He's been in Mexico 
He hasn't been very well 
What happened 
I'm leaving at once to meet him 
I see 
I suppose the general's quite pleased 
We haven't told him yet 
We thought it best to wait 
Thanks for telling me 
Have a nice trip 
I will Goodbye 
Goodbye 
Say mister would you please 
This is just our way of saying Lay off 
You the guy that's been tailing me 
Yeah 
My name's Jones 
Harry Jones 
I want to see you 
Swell 
Did you want to see those guys jump me 
I didn't care one way or the other 
You could've yelled for help 
You got brains 
Get my hat will you 
Help me up to my office 
And I've been around too 
Used to run a little liquor 
Rode the scout car with a Tommy gun in my lap 
Tough racket 
Terrible 
Sit down You make me nervous 
Maybe you don't believe me 
What do you want 
That's better 
I've got something to sell cheap 
Don't let me stop you 
Don't you want to even know who I am 
I already know 
You're not a cop 
So you must be one of Brody's friends 
So Agnes is loose again huh 
How'd you know that 
She's too big for you 
That's a dirty crack brother 
I suppose you're right 
Cut the babble What do you want 
If it does what 
Helps you find Regan 
This is getting funny 
People have been telling me that for days 
I don't even pass out cigars anymore 
Do you want to know what I've got or don't you 
I don't know 
200 buys a lot of information in my circle 
Would you pay $200 for that shamus 
I think I might 
Where 
Agnes found her 
You might tell the cops for nothing 
I ain't so brittle 
Agnes must have something I didn't notice 
I ain't tried to pull anything 
I came here with a straight proposition 
Take it or leave it 
One right guy to another 
I am 
Two hundred it is 
Have you got the money 
Where's Agnes 
Fulwider Building 
428 in the back 
No but I can find it 
I guess so 
Bring the dough 
I'll take you to Agnes 
Who are you 
What do you want 
I wanted to see you 
Who are you 
I work for Eddie Mars 
My name is Canino 
Sure 
I thought you would remember 
What do you want 
Who says I've been 
I do 
That was a mistake your mistake 
Eddie Mars don't like it 
Sit down and quit stalling 
Why are you tailing Marlowe 
All right there's no harm telling 
It was for Joe Brody's girl 
She's got to get out of town that takes dough 
She figured she could get it through Marlowe 
Why would he pay 
You know about the night the kid bumped Brody 
The young Sternwood girl was there 
Only Marlowe didn't tell the cops that 
I get it 
Where's this Agnes 
What do you care 
What do you want with her 
What's she got 
What's the matter Jones 
Ain't you ever seen a gun before 
Where's the girl 
You want me to count to three like a movie 
Where's Agnes 
You win 
She's in an apartment at 28 Court Street 
Apartment 301 
I guess I'm yellow all right 
You just got good sense 
You're nervous ain't you 
Maybe you need a drink 
I don't think so 
You got a glass 
At the water cooler 
There you are pal 
Drink her down 
Well drink it 
What do you think it is poison 
I bet that Agnes of yours wouldn't turn it down 
No I'll bet she wouldn't 
What's funny 
Nothing's funny 
So long Jonesy 
Thank you One moment please 
Courtview Apartments 
You got a girl living there named Agnes Lowzier 
Nobody by that name here 
Sorry Nothing like that 
Somebody just gave out the wrong address 
Thanks 
You did all right Jonesy 
But you left me high and dry 
Who is this 
What did you say 
I said Who is this 
Hello Agnes This is Marlowe 
Marlowe The man you want to see 
Is Harry there 
Yeah he's here 
Put him on will you 
He can't talk to you 
Why 
Because he's dead 
Your little man died to keep you out of trouble 
I got your money for you 
Do you want it 
Yeah I want it 
Have you got a car 
Where can I meet you 
Rampart and Oakwood 
I'll be there in half an hour 
What happened to Harry 
Here you are Here's your 200 
She was Eddie Mars' wife 
There was a fellow with her 
I know him 
We got curious and Joe tailed them 
About 10 miles east there's a side road 
That's where Eddie Mars' wife is holed up 
You sure of that 
Why should I lie 
So long copper Wish me luck 
I got a raw deal 
Well your kind always does 
What do you want 
Open up I got a flat back here on the highway 
Sorry mister We're closed for the night 
All right 
Come on in 
You'd scare off a lot of trade with that 
You can get yourself hurt kicking on doors 
Cut it out Art 
The guy's right 
You run a garage don't you 
Go ahead Give him a hand 
Thanks mister 
I suppose you can fix flats 
It's too damp for a good spray job Art 
You got time to fix his tires 
But I don't 
Get moving 
Sure 
Here's the key to the back 
Put the spare on That'll make it easier 
Yeah I took a skid up at the corner 
A front tire went Lucky to find some help 
You live around here 
Just drove in from Reno and Carson City 
Came the long way around huh 
Business trip 
Partly 
Having your car painted 
Just a spray job 
Art's pretty slow 
He should've been finished by now 
All right Art 
Take him in the house 
That's right 
Where is Shawn Regan 
I'd like to know that myself 
Hello angel 
I thought I'd find you here 
You don't seem to be running in front today 
Move that light will you Or move me 
I suppose we're in the house 
That's right 
The boys don't take any chances do they 
Where are they out digging a grave 
You had to go on with this didn't you 
Where are they 
They've gone to telephone 
To call up Eddie Mars huh 
To find out what to do with me 
I could've told them that 
Why did you have to go on 
Too many people told me to stop 
Light me a cigarette will you angel 
Why did you have to make trouble 
Eddie never did you any harm 
Besides I was never in love with Shawn 
We were just good friends 
Maybe he did kill him 
Eddie's not that kind 
You mean Eddie Mars never kills anybody 
You really believe that don't you 
Yes I do 
How do you suppose I knew you were here 
How did you 
A man named Harry Jones told me 
A funny little guy harmless 
I liked him 
How he found out is a long story 
I was in the next room 
Now that little man is dead 
But Eddie Mars didn't do that 
You're lying 
You think he's just a gambler don't you 
I think he's a blackmailer a hot car broker 
Stop talking 
A killer by remote control 
Anything with money pinned to it 
Anything rotten 
Ask him when you see him 
Well I got rid of her 
She's okay I like her 
You like too many people 
Never mind angel 
The water feels good 
I wonder if you'd do what she did for a man 
I was wondering that myself 
He doesn't know I was in the other room 
You know what he'll do when he finds out 
That'll be just a start 
Please don't talk like that 
You should have gone to Mexico 
Stop 
Please 
Then you couldn't have gone 
The border patrol would've checked you through 
People would've seen you without Regan 
Will you get out of this if I let you go 
Take this thing out of my mouth 
That's better 
Get a knife and cut these ropes 
Watch your fingers 
Don't cut toward your hand 
Who's got a key to these handcuffs 
I don't suppose there's a gun here 
None that I know of 
The boys made a fast trip 
What can you do 
Look angel I'm leaving you in a tough spot 
That's all right 
How do I get out of here 
That door leads onto a side porch 
I will 
All right Start counting 
Get going Art 
You heard what I said 
There 
Behind the wheel 
Over here Canino 
That looks like the key 
We'll have to take his car 
Why 
You'll be in it just as much as I will 
I don't mind as long as you're around 
You looked good Awful good 
I didn't know they made them like that anymore 
I guess I'm in love with you 
Will you go to the police with me 
I can't 
Why not 
What if I told you I killed Shawn Regan 
Would you tell the police that 
I will if you take me there 
I'm not going to 
Look angel I'm tired 
They'll all ask the same question: 
Where's Shawn Regan 
Don't ask any more questions 
I won't even ask how you got into this mess 
I'll ask Mars if I get there quick enough 
Why are you doing that 
I guess I'm in love with you 
Hello Let me talk to Mr Mars 
Hello Eddie This is Marlowe 
Yeah Marlowe or what's left of him 
That Canino's a pretty good boy 
You'll have trouble getting another as good 
What's the matter Eddie 
Can't you talk 
Only now it's me that's calling 
I want to see you 
Why don't you go to the police 
I just killed your best boy 
Do you want to see me 
All right Where 
Las Olindas is too far 
Not your apartment either 
Your house 
You mean the one that Geiger lived in 
All right When 
How long will it take me to get there 
I'll be there just as quick as I can 
It worked 
You're taking a chance 
He'll be here in 10 minutes 
Go and make sure that back door's locked 
You're the one who's shaking now 
I'm scared angel 
I'm sore too 
There they are 
Watch the back 
What is it 
The curtain 
Stop it swinging 
I got here first Eddie 
Put those scissors down 
Put them down 
Turn around 
Over there 
Sit down 
There's two men behind some trees 
Watch them 
Hello Mr Mars 
You double crossing 
I told you to sit down 
Leave her out of it 
She's all right 
But I didn't believe that 
Regan's dead all right but she didn't do it 
It was Carmen wasn't it 
How'd it happen 
She didn't tell 
I asked you how it happened 
Carmen liked Regan 
But he liked your wife 
And he said no to Carmen 
She gets mad when anybody says that 
I've seen her that way Go on 
I've seen her that way too 
Then you hid the body 
You can't prove that 
Prove it to me 
You've seen Carmen that way 
Sure I have Have you 
What'll you do 
You're smart 
You walked in without a gun 
You were going to agree to everything 
When I went out it'd be different 
That's what those boys are doing out there 
Angel get on the floor 
Don't get excited Marlowe 
What do you think will happen now 
What'll your boys think 
What'll they do to the first one out that door 
Will it be you or me 
Look 
You look at this 
Haven't you ever seen a gun before 
You want me to count to three 
Canino said that to Jonesy 
Don't go crazy 
Jonesy took it better than you 
That's one Eddie 
Don't 
That's two Eddie 
Don't shoot it's me 
Mars 
Bernie 
This is Marlowe 
I've got some more red points for you 
Who is it this time 
Eddie Mars 
His boys got him 
There's more to it than that He killed Regan 
I'll tell you about it 
Where are you 
And watch yourself They may still be outside 
Right away 
It won't take him long 
Wait Let me do the talking 
They have places for that 
Maybe they can cure her It's been done before 
You've forgotten one thing 
Me 
What's wrong with you 
Nothing you can't fix 
Good morning Lieutenant 
They are all here 
Her husband is with her 
You and your husband 
The name of the victim 
Frank Peralta

You saw him last night 
Around 10 o'clock He was coming home 
I was going out 
You know the young lady 
Never saw her 
Very pretty 
Gloves 
I do not think so 
I guess they were going home 
That's what I assumed 
And that was at 10 o'clock 
I think so 
We met face to face 
What do you know about her 
I live in the apartment under doctor Peralta 
About 10:35 last night I heard this thud 
How do you know the time 
I had just turned on the 10:30 news 
I heard footsteps on the stairs outside 
I opened my door a bit 
I was curiosity 
I'm glad you were 
From doctor Peraltas apartment 
I suppose so 
But you didn't see her come out of his door 
I'm not sure 
I don't think so 
Do you think you would recognize her 
Yes I'm sure 
I got a good look at her 
She passed under the light 
You're his secretary 
You don't like her 
I know very little about her 
You mean he thought he was 
Sometimes he did sometimes he didn't 
He was going to propose to her last night 
Teresa Collins 
You know where she lives

Why did you quarrel with him 
Jealous You think Rusty might have killed him

If you don't mind We'll break the alibi 
It might take time but 
I like you to leave 
I'd like go to bed 
You and 
So that's it 
My sister

Don't you like to reconsider 
Me 
Or her 
Will you tell me one thing 
One of us

We are identical 
You think so 
No I don't 
I know what our rights are and so will a judge 
Constitutional rights she says

You won this round 
Did you read up on this before you did it 
Never mind I don't want to hear it 
I forgot to tell you 
It's to twins Did you get that

Dr Elliott Mr Judge 
Thanks very much for coming 
That's right

Quite a coincident doctor 
Quite 
Scott Elliott psychologist Ph d author of: 
Twins and siblings 
All published by the faculty 
Your own field 
Did you know they were twins 
It's a superstition 
That clears that up 
Would you mind repeating it 
Go on 
I told him I had 
He used the word 'danger' 
Yes 
To which you replied 
I told him I couldn't say 
And then he said something: 
It's rather important And we separated 
Seeing whom tonight 
Miss Collins I suppose Which one 
I have no idea 
Take the girls outside 
You see 
You are going to let them get away with it 
I wouldn't have a chance in court 
We couldn't even get it pass the grant jury 
Let's have them back 
Come in 
The other is an accomplice 
I cannot express my contempt 
Now get out 
We are free 
You're free 
Goodbye Lieutenant 
Remember me 
Of course Lieutenant Come on in 
Sorry 
That's snobbish 
They are in my laboratory at the university 
What about the office in the Medical Building 
Lemon drop 
Have you given any thought to this twin case 
I supposed you've given that one up 
Not me personally This is on my own time 
You don't look ambitious 
It's not ambitious I don't like a perfect crime 
I cannot accept that which mocks justice 
Yes I thought about it 
I like them or one of them anyway 
You don't know which one 
You think you'd know if you did 
I imagine so 
This whole thing burns me to a crisp 
How do you know someone else didn't do it 
I guess not 
I can't bear it I can't bear it 
First tell me this 
You're a twin expert 
Sure What 
The crime 
You must be patient with me What do you mean 
Do you know why they lived so far apart 
Different characters 
I see 
It's the same here 
One could and one couldn't commit murder 
That's all there is to it 
Yeah That's all there is to it 
Constitutional rights 
Another thing: 
Do you often interview twins 
Often But not for the police 
What about the one you like 
What about her 
Suppose she is innocent 
There is no reason to think she is any danger 
Living with a killer 
It's not really my business that kind of thing 
Her sister if she ever became nervous about her 
I swear it 
The system works You can't beat it 
Social regularity 
That's your name for it 
It's out of question 
I am not a detective and I doubt I can help you 
I like her 
How do I know it wasn't her 
You can't just look at a person and know that 
She could have been killing people for years 
All I said is that she was very pleasant 
It's not easy to believe that 
Mr Lemon Drops 
Terry of course 
How are you 
Still champing candy 
I told you before I don't chump 
No Obviously you are both wonderful 
Things hasn't been so good 
Not so good 
No work 
One look at our face and 
I wish you wouldn't say things like that 
But he knows He must have read the papers 
I know but 
How do you mean 
I'm an old twin student remember 
And I like to add you girls to it 
I'd pay you Of course not much 
It should only be an hour each day 
We did that once when we were kids in Chicago 
I was doing it long before you meet you girls 
Which you're very likely to have 
What is your purpose in this 
And you'd pay us 
$ 25 per week for each 
That's the customary allowance 
What do you think 
In that case there is nothing more to be said 
I'm sorry for giving that impression 
I'm sorry too 
I think we should do it 
Why should I 
Or why should you 
And because 
We've always liked Dr Elliott Both of us 
Talk it over between yourselves and call me 
I hope to be seeing you both soon 
Goodbye We will call you 
What's the matter with you 
Do you think that was very wise 
What are you afraid of 
I'm not afraid It's 
Don't lie about it You are afraid 
You're more afraid every day Why 
Terry you know very well what it is 
You think I killed him Why don't you amid it 
I don't 
Then why are you so frightened 
I know you didn't do it 
That's the only reason I'm frightened 
Please believe me 
Of course not 
Then stop worrying there's no need for it 
I like him 
You don't think we can fool you now 
Not anymore Terry 
I even have you spotted in the magazine stand 
How do you mean 
Not all of course but some 
What was the difference 
I do not know meaning I'm not sure yet 
Which one do you like the best 
You Really 
Sit over here will you 
Why 
Why what 
Why do you say you like me best 
What is this one 
These are pictures of ink spots 
It is just a stain and the paper folded over 
What is it for 
It's another way of studying personality 
What it looks like to you 
Quickly 
If you see it quickly sure 
Face that way please 
Well what does it look like to you 
It might be a mask 
Anything else 
May I turn it 
Anyway you wish 
This looks like a white lamb with a black nose 
He got a mark on its forehead 
It all seems symbolic of something 
Symbolic of what 
The lamb's death 
I wonder if you are as so cool as you pretend 
No I think so either 
What do you see 
What does it looks like to you Terry 
Here is a dancer a woman dancing with a puppet 
Can I have a cigarette 
Why did you leave Nebraska Ruth 
They could only afford one of us 
Why you instead of Terry 
So we decided to pull out 
What do you see 
Two people in costume dancing around a pole 
They are bending over 
It's that what you wanted 
Yes 
Anything else 
You can turn it if you wish 
These are two skaters like in the ice show 
Terry how did she find out 
Was he cranky 
No I got along fine with him but Terry 
What do you see 
They seem frightened 
And look at those chins 
That's a drum majorette with a high bear shako 
She's very straight and graceful 
And she got her knee high in the air 
Thank you very much 
Well it's about time 
Sorry I'm late 
Did you go through town No 
Scott and I just talked 
After that ink spot stuff 
Who do you suppose ever thought that one up 
Talking about what 
Just gapping 
Chicago movies when we were kids 
Not about us 
He must have been 
He was really 
The way he was before remember 
Is that his line down the memory lane 
Nothing romantic 
I'm afraid not 
Dear me you sound disappointed 
You're not falling for him 
Falling for someone Of course not 
Just don't want to see you do anything foolish 
Yes Momma 
I don't know of course 
I can't believe it 
If only we weren't so 
I know 
It's not very pleasant 
Particularly him 
As promised I will not ask any questions 
You know the ink spot test 
One of our young women is insane 
Very clever very intelligent but insane 
This is called a free association test 
And it's so simple that even I understand 
Is that official 
She has been the older sister 
Always helping me and protecting me 
This is not a contest 
Yes sir 
You know 
I'm a very pleased man today 
I'm sorry 
I did not mean to 
But it's all right now 
Yes okay 
Good the way it ought to be 
But back to cold science 
Not a sentence just one word 
Are you ready 
Table 
Chair 
Ready 
Dark 
Night 
Moon 
Beams 
Knife 
Scissors 
White Black 
Mirror Death 
King 
Blossom 
Flower 
River Lake 
How could you have said it 
How do I know It just popped out 
None None whatever 
He can't frightened me with that stuff 
It's you I'm worried about 
Why 
Terry please 
I've told you 
Why do you keep saying a thing like that 
Forget it 
But you have not right even to think 
Why do you take these sleeping pills 
Neither of us has 
Is that all 
What other reason could there be 
Not your conscience 
My conscience about what 
Maybe that's what troubling you 
Maybe you think you should do it even now 
Because if you are the phone is there 
Terry stop it You're talking nonsense 
Am I 
Of course you are 
I hope so 
Because if you ever suspected me 
Table 
Chair 
Moon Stars 
King 
Death Mirror 
Girl 
Woman 
Black White 
Rose Thorn 
Then why do you think I'm here 
Just to humoring the old professor 
Is that all Nothing else to do 
No it hadn't 
Don't you like to see me 
Honest Very honest 
We will I'm sure 
Would you like to Very much 
All right when 
Soon 
What does that got to do with it 
The first night afterward 
It's a date Remember 
I will remember Terry 
How did you find out 
He dated her one night and she told me 
Terry turned in 
How many men have you been crazy about 
That was just a kid stuff We were about 16 
No this is personal 
I want to know everything about you for myself 
And apparently you will Good night 
You think you'll still want to 
I'm looking forward to it Do you mind 
No 
I like it 
You are a wonder 
It's all right 
I'm not asleep 
Don't turn on the light 
I'll undress in the bathroom 
You're taking a sleeping pill tonight 
No I slept all right last night 
You mean I talked Talked cried 
You scare me half to death sometimes 
Good heavens 
Dreaming I suppose No 
You don't remember what you dream 
I don't remember even dreaming 
You don't remember my waking you last night 
when you were sobbing No 
Or what you said to me 
What did I say 
You don't remember what it was 
I do not remember anything 
But I thought you awakened 
Pretty haring for a few minutes 
Has it happened before 
A few times 
You think a lot of him often 
I do like him but 
Does he like you 
Some I imagine 
Ever said anything 
Nothing serious just casual things 
Ever kissed you 
He maybe just trying to pump you 
I don't think so 
I don't know 
You talked about before in your sleep 
You were worried about one of us being crazy 
But that's not true that's a superstition 
I know 
Didn't you hear Scott say it wasn't 
Yes I heard him 
This is so awful 
It frightens me 
I know but 
Such a thought 
What's this one 
Blood pressure and pulse 
A lie detector That's an easy name 
Do you mind 
Why should I 
How much longer 
Winding up this week 
Friday afternoon and that's that 
The whole thing Yes the work is complete 
Then Saturday is the night 
Oh sure 
Remember 
That's right 
Well I'm afraid I did forget 
I'm terribly sorry 
You mean you can't make it 
Any other night but 
What a man 
Who's my rival 
You have no rival 
Your memory is too good 
There's nothing to straighten out 
My heart is broken that's all 
Not on any forbidden subject 
That you better ask her 
Of course 
I hope so anyway 
What are you gonna ask me 
Anything interesting about that time 
Off hand 
Freddie Eckland 
Yes I think 
In Dayton 
What did she say 
Did she tell you that I met him first 
No I don't think she did 
He started to go around with her 
What is it dear 
That light again Wake up 
You're dreaming again 
No it wasn't a dream 
Didn't you see it There wasn't anything to see 
You're dreaming 
It wasn't a dream 
Now you're all right 
There is nothing to be afraid of 
But I was sure I saw it 
It doesn't matter it really doesn't 
But what is it what do you think it is 
Your nerves playing tricks on you that's all 
I'm so scared 
I'm scared 
It's nothing really 
No matter what happens 
So that's all there is to it 
Yes that's all I'm afraid 
I didn't promise you a great deal more 
All I can say is that Ruth did not do it 
That does narrows it down a bit 
Paranoiac is capable of anything 
That's something but not much 
Unfortunately Pretty tough on Ruth 
You're gonna tell her 
I suppose so 
But it's not gonna be easy 
She hasn't a ghost of suspicion 
No What about that double alibi 
She could've been tricked 
Much applied anyway 
Sorry I couldn't have been more help to you 
You gonna see Ruth again soon 
It's quite possible 
And watch out for yourself 
That was the first tip I got from her 
Don't be too modest 
All right I'll tell her 
Tonight if I can 
If I was that doctor I would feel nervous 
The target for tonight 
That's the way it is 
Hello Ruth 
Hello Scott 
How are you dear 
You are alone Yes 
Why I don't want Terry to know 
Could I see you alone tonight 
Of course 
When Whatever you say 
Could I make it rather late 
Around 11 
Suppose I come to your apartment at 11 
I'll leave the door open 
It's upstairs I understand 
Do you mind 
No Of course not 
I couldn't be more pleased 
I was wondering what to do next 
Not that's anything important 
Feeling depressed 
Something like that 
Have you had your dinner 
Instead of dinner with me tomorrow night 
Tonight dear we should have it with music 
Are you sure you don't want to tell me 
What causes hallucinations 
Hallucinations 
Things you imagine you see or hear 
Bad nerves 
Just nerves 
Or a sick mind 
May I explain something 
Would you get my bag and gloves 
Of course 
Police headquarters 
Lieutenant Stevenson please 
Lieutenant This is Scott Elliott 
So you got the picture at last 
It's possible 
Would you still be there 10:30 
I'll be right here from 10:39 on 
Here we go again 
Looks He is no fool for a university 
Are you ready 
Thanks Come on you can do better than that 
I was worried 
Walk 
With Scott 
Haven't you seen him 
He called around 7 Who 
Scott 
I tell you I haven't seen him 
You just come in 
No I'm just going out 
Do not be silly I'm all right 
Have you been taking your capsule 
No Why 
They're no good 
Maybe you don't take enough 
But be careful don't take too many 
Look darling try not to worry so much 
I know 
So don't be too scared 
Remember that darling always 
Good night 
I won't stay out too late 
I'm so glad you came 
I wondered about how you lived 
Could I get you something to drink 
I was just puzzled that you needed an excuse 
I would have come anyway 
But it wasn't an excuse 
Does it have to be tonight 
I'm afraid so my dear 
It's about Terry 
You don't like Terry 
Of course I like her 
But 
But I love you 
Why 
Why do I love you 
Why me and not her 
I'm very curious 
Why choose me instead of her 
We're so much alike 
How can I answer that 
Am I better looking than she 
To me you are of course 
Don't laugh 
For instance Kiss me 
Or my lips from hers 
I think so 
Have you ever kissed her 
No 
Then how can you possible know 
Would you really 
I think so I don't believe it for a second 
She is the one that really sense them 
That's not true 
But of course it's true 
Terry is not well she's sick inside 
She needs help from you and me if possible 
Sick 
She is twisted inside 
How it got started I don't know 
Some incident when you were babies I imagine 
She needs care right away 
Terry and I has never been rivals 
Not the slightest 
Luck they say 
Between sisters it's a little bit more serious 
Go on 
But not she 
That is of course a lie 
I'm sorry but it isn't 
The boy Dayton 
It's the same story over again 
I've never listen to such utter nonsense 
I want you to persuade her to go to a doctor 
I want you to get her to do this at once 
And if I refuse to insult her with this 
And if she refuses 
If you refuse 
Terry 
You can't You don't know 
I think I do 
Shall I remind you anyway 
If you wish 
That's why he asked me about split personality 
Then you knew it had happen again 
It was Ruth he was in love with not you 
Who else have you told this to 
Go to your doctor and be guided by what he says 
I see no need for that 
You don't think so 
Haven't you forgot Ruth 
Not at all 
I don't suppose so 
Or hasn't she told you 
What do you mean by that 
Where's Ruth now 
Are you so sure of which one you've kissed 
Of course 
Look closely Are you certain 
Do you still got that Terry with you 
Who is that 
The guy from the hospital 
I bee with you in a minute 
Sorry doc but I have bad news 
What 
All right Stevenson I'll be right over 
Ruth has committed suicide 
Does that surprises you 
I'm terribly sorry but 
I'm terribly sorry Miss Collins 
Sit here 
May I go in 
If you want to 
Can you tell me what happened 
She took some of this sleeping pills 
It was empty in the bathroom 
Yes I'm afraid she did 
What was it Miss Collins 
Her conscience 
Take your time I'm not pressing you 
I'm all right 
Of course you have Tell me everything 
You'd feel better 
She killed him 
She killed him 
She said she didn't but I know she did 
I believed her at first 
Take this down 
That night what happened 
I got home from the park she was in bed 
I thought asleep 
You believed her then 
Yes but 
Something was the matter with Terry 
She was twisted You mean Ruth 
No Terry 
I'm Ruth 
It was a kind of deep bitterness 
Wait 
I thought you were Terry 
No I'm talking about Terry I'm Ruth 
But didn't you 
Didn't I what 
Nothing I am a little 
Go on 
He didn't know that we were two of us 
Just a minute 
What are you trying to pull 
I'm just telling what you told me 
Just about what you told me 
But this isn't Ruth this is Terry 
Scott we've been over that 
This is ridiculous 
I know this is Terry 
How do you know 
I have no difficulty with telling them apart 
Can you prove it 
She says she's Ruth and she sounds like Ruth 
Prove me wrong 
Shall I go on 
We're getting somewhere 
Whichever they met first 
I'm sorry dear 
You're not surly 
Of course not 
You know why I got nervous 
Psychological reasons 
I take back what I said about the police 
$9 75 this week only 
Was the mirror me 
The reflection was 
Will you answer one question for me

Last minute conference at the office 
You got my message 
Yes It's all right Alex 
Sweet of you to wait 
I was afraid you might run on 
Oh I'm not that easily put off 
I was too anxious to meet you again 
You know I'm tired 
You seem to have escaped all of that 
You always affected me like a tonic 
Oh uh would you like another drink 
Yes Thank you 
Deux martinis 
You know him 
No I don't think so But he seems familiar 
Captain Prescott intelligence man 
The American embassy is loaded with them 
Really 
Hey he's rather handsome isn't he 
I'm allergic to American agents 
Have the bothered you since you came down 
No No not yet 
They were troublesome in Miami 
I wondered why you left your father 
He insisted 
He was so unselfish 
He kept worrying about me begging me to leave 
I had no idea he was going to die 
Many things have died for all of us 
We mustn't let our spirit die with them 
Perhaps I can help you to forget 
I'd like to 
It's odd but I feel at home with you 
I'd feel what I used to for you 
The same hunger 
You're so lovely my dear 
There's someone else of course 
Who is it this time 
That Mr Devlin you were with 
There is no one 
He seemed attentive 
I met him on the plane from Miami 
You made a pretty couple 
Oh Alex Mr Devlin doesn't interest me 
You'll let me help your loneliness 
Thank you very much 
My house 
Yes how nice

Yes He thought you were very handsome 
Oh you don't say 
Sorry I'm not going with you 
All right 
You mean the Germans 
That won't be difficult for me 
And I suggest that you don't ask any questions 
Just use your eyes and ears 
They're a pretty keen and desperate bunch 
Don't underestimate them 
Right Thank you for your instructions 
Good evening 
Yes I understand 
That's all Good luck 
Good evening Good night 
Good evening 
I'm Miss Huberman 
Will you tell Mr Sebastian that I'm here 
Miss Huberman 
Yes 
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting 
Not at all 
You resemble your father very much 
I'm Alex's mother 
I knew when I saw you 
Alex has always admired you 
Now at last I know why 
You're very kind 
I wonder why 
Hello Alicia 
I'm so glad You met my mother

Delighted 
And Mr Knerr 
And Dr Anderson 
Dr Anderson 
It gives me great pleasure 
Dr Anderson is our guest of honor tonight 
Not before dinner anyway 
Dinner is served madame 
Eric you will sit next to Miss Huberman 
You have just come from Spain senora 
A few weeks ago It seems ages 
One has the feeling of not going anywhere 
You can expect many strange things 
See a good movie this afternoon Eric 
No I was disappointed 
Hmm must have been a comedy 
You know Eric loves to go to the movies to cry 
He's very sentimental 
No It was a very dangerous slip 
It's not the first one 
There have been several other lapses before 
There'll be more if we permit them 
That's bad That's very bad 
It is very high 
There are some very awkward turns 
It's quite a trick to jump clear 
I'll just have to be careful that is all 
Turned my ankle the last time 
Oh I think we'll take coffee in here Emil 
Ah nonsense We all have nerves 
Oh that's very considerate 
I am very tired 
I shall drive you 
No That would be too much for you 
All that way That's too much to ask 
Nonsense I'd love to go 
Come on Emil Good night gentlemen 
Good night Alex 
I hope you'll feel better in the morning Emil 
Thank you 
Very sorry 
Thank you Alex for an excellent dinner 
Miss Huberman has been gone a long time 
I do wish you'd be a little more cordial to her 
Really I thought I was behaving rather well 
Has she been complaining about me 
I'm grateful 
You might smile at her 
Please Mother I want to enjoy myself 
Is it so boring to sit with me alone 
Not at all not at all 
Hello 
Oh hello 
I thought I saw you 
How are you 
Fine thanks 
Great turnout isn't it Yes 
Where are they 
In a box in the stand 
Don't telephone me anymore 
Just rely upon my popping up 
Can you hear me 
Sure Go ahead 
Heard of a Dr Anderson 
No 
He's some kind of a scientist 
Tall or short 
Short 
No 
Didn't like the vintage 
Was there No 
It was wine We drank it 
Has he pulled anything since 
Haven't seen him since 
Anything else 
Nothing important 
What is it 
Pretty fast work 
That's what you wanted wasn't it 
Skip it 
Are you betting on this race 
No 
Alex says number ten is sure to win 
He knows the owner 
Thanks for the tip 
I can't help recalling some of your remarks 
You idiot 
What are you sore about 
You knew very well what I was doing 
Did I 
You could have stopped me with one word 
But no you wouldn't You threw me at him 
I threw you at nobody 
Didn't you tell me to go ahead 
A man doesn't tell a woman what to do 
She tells herself 
Oh you're rotten 
That's why I didn't stop you 
The answer had to come from you 
I see Some kind of love test 
That's right 
Lucky for both of us I didn't 
She's been made over by love 
I hate you 
There's no occasion to 
You're doing good work 
Is that all you have to say to me 
Dry your eyes baby It's out of character 
Except keep on your toes 
It's a tough job we're on 
Oh hello Alex 
It was so exciting 
A beautiful horse Do you remember Mr Devlin 
How do you do 
Hello 
So long 
See you sometime Dev 
It was a wonderful race 
Did you have much money on the winner 
I didn't see the race 
Didn't you 
I was watching you and your friend Mr Devlin 
I presume that's why you left my mother and me 
You had an appointment to meet him 
Don't be absurd 
I met him purely by accident 
Oh he's just 
I watched you 
I thought maybe you're in love with him 
Don't talk like that 
I detest him 
Really 
He's very good looking 
I'd like to be convinced 
I'm delighted gentlemen 
One of Germany's scientific wizards 
I didn't know he was here 
They call him Dr Anderson 
Entree 
What do you mean 
She's here 
Yes sir 
Well show her in Ribiero 
Yes sir 
I don't like this 
I don't like her coming here 
What sort is that Mr Beardsley 
Not at all not the slightest 
Take it easy Dev 
Sorry 
Withdrawn 
Apologized sir 
How do you do Miss Huberman 
How do you do 
This is Mr Beardsley and SenorJulio Barbosa 
Care to sit down 
Thank you 
In fact I need it before lunch 
Something happened 
Yes something rather confusing 
Mr Sebastian has asked me to marry him 
What 
Well well 
Yes if you wish 
What do you think of this Devlin 
Oh I think it's a useful idea 
He's in love with me 
And he thinks you're in love with him 
Yes that's what he thinks 
Gentlemen it's the cream of the jest 
Then Then it's all right 
Well yes I'd I'd say so 
Of course it's a perfect marriage for us 
There's only one thing Won't it delay us a bit 
What do you mean 
Yes 
Won't that hold us up 
Devlin's got a point there 
Yes I think I can manage that 
Well everything seems to be nicely arranged 
Yes Thank you very much 
Don't be absurd Mother 
She didn't even know I was here 
We will discuss it more fully tonight 
We will not discuss it tonight 
In this case there's nothing more to discuss 
I mean that the wedding will be next week 
It'll be private 
Oh Good evening sir Madame 
Good evening Joseph 
I'm sorry sir 
Why not 
I telegraphed her 
Where is my mother 
Madame Sebastian went to bed very early sir 
That's all right Alex 
Well what shall we do 
Not unless you want to 
I'm rather tired myself 
We'll go right up then 
Good night 
Good night madame 
Don't hang anything up 
I'd like to know where everything goes 
Oh Joseph would you have the closets aired 
Yes madame 
Oh this isn't very large 
I'll need more room 
This door is locked 
That's used for a storeroom madame 
Oh May I have the key 
I do not have the keys madame 
Where are they 
Oh Do you know where Mr Sebastian is 
I miss Hupka 
He was a first class metallurgist 
What uh were you asking 
Oh you want a report 
A written report 
Well my friends my work is done 
You've been successful 
Oh I'm very sorry I 
Not at all Come on in 
No I'm sorry to interrupt you 
I didn't know you were busy 
Some of the closets are locked 
Could you give me the keys 
Oh I'm so sorry 
I'd forgotten about the keys 
Of course I'll get them for you at once 
I'll bring the keys to you right away my dear 
Mother Mother 
Come in 
Well here they are 
See you at lunch 
Thank you dear 
Mr Sebastian has the key for this madame 
It's the wine cellar 
Alex has the key to that 
Then get it from him 
Get it 
How 
Don't you live hear him 
What do I look for if I get the key 
All the bottles look alike to me 
I'm no mastermind 
You're doing all right 
It's no fun Dev 
Too late for that now isn't it 
Why 
The honeymoon isn't over huh 
Don't underestimate your charms Mrs Sebastian 
You can handle it 
He thinks you're in love with me 
That sounds very logical 
Good Next week then and get the key 
All right 
I'll be looking forward to seeing you 
It's always a pleasure meeting you madame 
I'm surprised at Mr Devlin coming tonight 
I'll be with you in a minute 
Darling 
Will you forgive me for even talking about it 
I'm very contrite 
I think all our guests are here 
Where can I find Alex Sebastian 
By the drawing room sir 
Thanks 
Hello Dev 
Good evening 
You haven't seen the house have you 
Well it's quite a jolly little cottage 
Let me show you around the place 
Later 
He's on the trail 
Devlin glad to see you 
Good evening 
It was kind of your bride to invite me 
You know what 
Oh excuse me 
Madame Esterich I'm so glad to see you 
This isn't going to be easy 
Why He uh he's quite sensitive about you 
He's going to watch us like a hawk 
Yes he's rather jealous of anyone 
Where'd you get the key off his chain 
Yes 
Oh I hadn't thought about that 
Quite a point 
Thank you 
Oh Mr Devlin How nice 
You remember me 
Senora Ortiz 
Oh here's something I adore 
champagne Oh may I 
Joseph 
Madame 
I don't know madame 
I hope so 
Enjoying yourself Mr Devlin 
Very much thank you 
I haven't heard anything for a long time 
Would you mind 
Certainly 
We better hurry 
Lots of time 
No Joseph might have to ask Alex for more wine 
Oh I'm sorry to hear that 
Is he uh watching 
Yes 
Nice party isn't it 
It's a wonderful party 
And you're doing wonderfully well 
I'm very proud 
They've played waltzes all evening 
Go my dear 
That's the door 
Right 
What happened 
Look Vintage sand 
Hmm We've got to leave things as we found them 
But it isn't really sand is it 
No I think it's some kind of metal ore 
This is a bit weird 
I'm terrified 
Just pretend you're a janitor 
Janitors are never terrified 
I have a feeling we're very slow 
Well we're on schedule 
Take it easy 
I keep hearing someone coming 
Oh that'll be nice 
Think if he comes down with Joseph 
Unfortunate 
Okay 
Come on 
Someone is coming 
It's Alex 
He's seen us 
Wait a minute I'm going to kiss you 
No he'd only think we'd 
That's what I want him to think 
You'd better stay upstairs Joseph 
They may need you 
Yes sir 
Oh Dev Dev 
Push me away 
I'm sorry to intrude on this tender scene 
I I couldn't help what happened 
He's been drinking 
Oh So he carried you down here 
Oh please Alex 
You love him 
No of course not 
Please go 
I knew her before you loved her before you 
But I wasn't as lucky as you Sorry Alicia 
Please go 
Good night 
Alex don't be foolish 
He kissed you 
I I couldn't stop him 
I tried 
We'll talk about it later 
Your guests are upstairs 
Will you please go to them 
Oh Mr Devlin are you going so soon 
Thank you and good night 
Oh Joseph 
Yes sir 
We can go down for the wine now 
Yes sir 
You know Joseph 
We still have some upstairs haven't we 
Yes sir 
And some whiskey and wine 
Yes sir 
Well I think we'll give them that 
Very good sir 
I'm sorry about what happened Alex 
Then you believe me 
Well of course 
It isn't worth mentioning again 
Thank you 
Are you coming up 
Not for a little while 
Dr Anderson's waiting for me in the study 
Sleep well 
It was a very successful party 
Good night then 
Good night 
Thanks for being so nice 
Mother 
Mother 
Why are you up so early 
I need your help 
Something is wrong 
A great deal Alicia 
I have expected it 
I knew I knew 
What is it 
Mr Devlin 
No 
I am married to an American agent 
Yes It is easy to see now 
I knew but I didn't see 
They picked her because of her father 
Stop wallowing in your foul memories 
Then what do I do 
There's nothing to do 
I'm done finished 
They'll find out 
They won't find out 
They'll find out what I'm married to 
And I've betrayed them 
I've bungled and there's no excuse 
I'd do the same myself 
kill the fool that betrayed them 
There's no need for them to find out 
Mathis is very sharp 
Yes He dislikes you 
For a time 
Alicia I'll take care of her myself 
No Not that way 
I stood looking at her when she was asleep 
I could have 
Quiet Alex 
You barred me from that episode 
Let me arrange this one 
Listen to me 
No one must know what she is 
There must be no suspicion of her of you or me 
She must be allowed to move about freely 
But she will be on a leash 
She will learn nothing further to inform 
She must go but it must happen slowly 
Drink your coffee darling 
It's getting cold 
Are you going out this afternoon Alex 
Oh I just have a little shopping 
I'd like to go to the Imperiale 
Should be about 1 000 of them 
Anything wrong 
No No the light bothers me 
I have a bit of a headache 
Would you mind 
Oh yes I think we can fix that 
Thank you 
So now we know what we're driving at 
But I think you'll be of great help 
All right 
No 
No 
To Spain 
Does Mr Devlin know that 
Oh yes 
He asked for the transfer 
Oh he wants to leave Rio 
Yes I imagine it would be 
Well of course it is more or less routine now 
Thank you Captain Prescott 
I'll keep my ears wide open 
Good bye 
Good bye 
Oh and uh go easy on that sun hey 
Daring what is it 
I don't know I 
Are you in pain 
Yes I 
I'm so dizzy I 
Wh What happened to her 
We were walking and she was stricken suddenly 
I'll be all right 
Let's go inside 
I'm sorry I couldn't make it on time 
Yes Rio can be a very dull town 
What's new 
Nothing 
What's new with you 
Nothing 
Any domestic troubles about the other night 
No 
Any footprints in that sand yet 
No Nothing yet 
Just a social visit huh 
A little fresh air helps 
You don't look so hot 
Well 
Sick 
No Hangover 
That's news 
Back to the bottle again huh 
It sort of 
lightens my chores 
Big party 
Just the family circle 
Sounds quite jolly 
It helps life in a dull town 
You ought to take it easy on that liquor 
Don't you find Rio a little hard to take too 
Not a bad town 
You look all mashed up 
Must have been quite an evening 
Yeah It was 
No reason why you shouldn't 
That's right Dev 
A scarf that you leant me once in Miami 
I should have given it to you sooner 
What is it 
Cleaning house huh 
Well good bye Dev 
What do you mean good bye 
Nothing Just good bye 
Sit down You're still tight 
I don't want to 
Where are you going 
Back home 
You are not taking care of yourself Alicia 
Oh I feel much better 
You look like something awful 
The circles under the eyes 
I never go near doctors 
They always want to cart you off to a hospital 
Maybe you belong in a hospital 
Tell me 
When did you first feel sick 
Oh I I don't remember 
Maybe the party 
I think 
A little cruise somewhere 
Maybe Spain 
Put the roses back in your cheeks my sweet 
I don't think so 
I don't care much for boats 
I always get seasick 
Then you might like the mountains hmm 
The air is fresh and pure and 
I am going next week 
Oh you're leaving 
I'm sorry I'll miss you 
Yes I'm delaying my work too long 
covered with flowers and 
Did you Really 
Mmm yes 
About the beautiful little native towns 
Tell me are you going to Leopoldina 
No no no 
I'm going to Santa Ma 
Care for some more brandy Otto 
No no thank you 
I'll just finish my coffee 
No that is not your cup 
But that's Ali 
Oh I'm sorry 
Yeah perhaps uh Alex is right my dear child 
When you're young rest's the best doctor 
And if you 
Excuse me I I want to go to bed I feel 
Pain again darling 
I'm sorry to complain again 
Shall I take you up to your room 
May I help you my dear 
Some hot water maybe 
No No please 
Don't bother 
I'll be all right 
I don't like the way she looks Alex 
I'm worried about her 
I'm afraid she's very ill 
Alicia Alicia 
Joseph Joseph 
Help me take her up to her room 
You must take her up to bed 
Come on my dear 
Okay I told you she is sick 
Come on Don't exert yourself 
Come Be quiet

We must get a doctor 
Poor child is suffering too much 
I'll call the hospital 
I'll get a doctor 
Don't worry dear Otto 
We'll get a doctor 
a good one We'll take the best care of her 
Joseph disconnect the telephone 
Madame must have absolute quiet 
Take it out of the room Joseph 
Five days eh 
Say that must be quite a binge she's on 
I don't think so 
Yes but I've had time to think it over 
Think what over 
That drinking of hers 
I don't believe it 
Why should she lie to you about that 
I don't know 
She wasn't drunk 
She was sick 
Maybe that's why she hasn't shown up 
She looked like the ragged end of nowhere 
Well it still sounds like a hangover 
Yes but I'm gonna pay her a call 
Now wait a minute 
I don't want you to mess things up 
We hope to close this case out in a few days 
I won't mess anything up 
Just a social call 
I uh I'm a friend of the family 
Oh and uh call me up when you get back 
I'll do that 
Good evening sir 
Good evening

Why not

That horse is a great horse 
Yeah he's a really great horse 
As soon as I said Go Bersagliere 
he started off like a rocket 
I don't think there is another one like that 
Not even in America 
That's nonsense 
In America 
Who knows how much they feed horses over there 
You call this a horse 
And what is it 
It's a small table 
Mr Anucci that one is always kidding around 
Is the proposal still good 
50 or nothing 
But 50 bills are 50 bills 
What are they 
Only paper Easy to say 
Come on let's go 
Is it really expensive to have a horse 
At least 300 lira a day 
Goodness Bersagliere how expensive you are 
Can we do it in a week 
It's okay with me 
Your word 
My word 
Your word 
My word 
Goodbye Mr Anucci 
Goodbye 
It's right 
How much do we have on hand 
I'm not sure 32 35 
Why don't you know 
I told you to be accurate 
Here Five 10 
I made all stacks of five 
That's good 
15 20 25 30 31 32 33 500 
Plus 7 500 for the guy from Genoa 
And the 3 700 for the porter's lodge 
Marcello did the stuff arrive 
When you bring 
Tomorrow 
To you and your mother 
These pay you know 
Hey Pasquale do you want to buy this 
No they're just a headache 
You can't hide them or cover them up 
Forget it someone else will buy them 
Let's go 
I'm thinking that one eats more than we do 
Who The horse 
Right Shoeshine Joe 
How can we do it 
That one will starve him to death 
Right we were born yesterday 
Yes but that way he would eat only once 
And me 
Right and at your house 
No one will cry if I free up the space 
We'll see 
Giuseppe 
What's up 
Giuseppe please 
Shoeshine Joe 
and he started off like a 
Running in circles 
Get lost 
I meant to say 
Get lost

Just look at him 
Who wouldn't want him as a son 
Let's go 
We've got to be brave 
My poor sons

It was that week 
Before Father Lambert was killed

Chief there's an easier way of doing this 
No We're wasting a lot of time 
No Okay you're the boss 
Did he No 
He said he didn't know of anything 
Then he gave me a lecture and a pamphlet 
Is that what got you sore at him

Psychiatrist 
What do you think of him 
Pretty hard to tell 
He's under a lot of stress Yes I know 
But does he sound like a murderer or not 
I couldn't say 
He's just out of the army 
That might account for his bitterness a little 
The difficulty of readjustment or possibly 
Or possibly it's something else 
Haven't you ever Maybe I'd better not ask that 
Perhaps not 
I don't know yet It's pretty early 
Why don't you do that 
Tell him we're waiting for his report

If I didn't want to I'd tell you 
That's what I thought 
Why not stay at the Terrace Hotel 
Do you like it 
Yes Then it's the Terrace 
Somebody meeting you when we get off the ferry 
No I'm going to pick up a cab Swell 
I'm afraid not 
We go in different directions 
That's where you're wrong 
We're going in the same direction you and I 
Here's your laundry Mrs Perth Okay 
That coffee smells good 
The aroma is always better than the actuality 
Telephone 
Hello 
Mr Arnett 
Who's calling 
No he's not here 
I don't know when he'll be back 
A debtor I take it Yep 
Et tu Brutus 
But I want $8 55 for the phone 
That would leave me embarrassingly short 
Now look 
But I have a prospective client 
The one that called here on Tuesday 
I am meeting her in exactly three minutes 
What does this one want 
Is her husband stepping out on her or what 
Murder 
Mrs Kraft 
Obviously 
Who'd you expect 
Quite so 
Well I've been in this business some 20 years 
That beer Does it every time 
Well Mrs Kraft how can I serve you 
I know all that 
First there is a slight monetary transaction 
How much 
Five hundred dollars should retain me nicely 
Five hundred 
You think I'm a millionaire 
How do you know 
I'm a detective 
Remember 
What about the Fifty Two Club 
Remember the New Year's we spent there 
A gentlemen to see you Mrs Brent A Mr Wild 
Oh ask him to come in please 
Hello Hello there 
I didn't expect you 
This is my sister Georgia Staples Sam Wild 
How do you do 
How do you do 
And Fred Grover my fiancé 
Hello Hiya 
Won't you sit down 
No thanks 
I see you're going out 
No matter what Fred has to eat 
I'll be running along Nice to meet you 
You'd be saving me from that hideous fate 
Why no 
Strangely enough I haven't 
Well Helen you just missed a thing in Reno 
Have they any idea who did it No 
No not yet 
Go on and get your things 
Wonder why women are so fascinated by murder 
Much more so than men You ever noticed 
No I haven't 
That murder happened the night before you left 
Didn't you hear anything about it 
No I left early the next morning 
Were both their pictures in the paper 
Yes she was quite a good look 
How did you know two people were murdered 
As a matter of fact I discovered the bodies 
What 
I'd rather you not mention it 
Didn't you scream 
Why didn't you call the police 
On account of Fred 
Getting involved with that is sure to be messy 
I don't think so 
If I had information it'd be different 
But I couldn't tell them anything could I 
Well maybe you're right 
Of course I'm right 
Will you take care of this 
Certainly Mr Grover 
Thank you Pierre 
Come on Fred let's dance 
You don't mind do you Helen 
I certainly do 
But go ahead Thank you my sweet 
Why him

I wanna know I don't get it 
Like to dance 
No thanks 
Afraid 
Afraid 
Of what 
You might change your mind about marrying him 
Why don't you 
What are you waiting for 
Fred's mother died recently 
Naturally he wants to wait a few months 
Well what's so funny 
You wanted to see me again

You don't think I can do you 
I haven't given it a thought 
Why shouldn't I be 
Don't you realize my wife's very attractive 
Can you remember all your men 
Leave me out of this 
Okay 
Just one more thing 
Georgia's my sister and I love her very much 
You don't know anything do you 
That's nice of me isn't it 
After all she's given me without even thinking 
I know how you feel 
There's more to it than that 
She's completely innocent 
And I make a very bad enemy too 
Goodbye sister 
Mrs Brent Yes Grace what is it 
I thought you'd better see him 
Thank you 
I don't know a few weeks 
They're getting ready to leave 
Would you give me your wallet please 
He said he was hungry 
A detective 
Or operative as we euphemistically call it 
Your ethics touch me deeply 
Noblesse oblige 
Good day 
Grace 
Show this man out at once please 
Helen We've been looking for you 
What in heaven made you dream that up 
You should have your house to yourself 
Darling that's silly 
Of course I'll stay

Georgia dear Yes 
It was a silly idea moving out 
Goodbye brother 
Goodbye 
Come on darling 
Better hurry You'll miss your train 
I hope his coming didn't upset you Mrs Brent 
Upset me 
Why no 
His coming here made me feel wonderful 
I know I was rude 
It's all right Forget it 
You've known him a long time 
Yeah 
Yeah Sam and I lived together five years now 
I had some business to take care of and 
Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean to pry Really not 
Drink up and let's have another shot Good 
I must warn you though liquor makes me nosy 
Cold sober too 
Grace 
Hello Fred Hello 
All what 
About Mart Waterman moving in 
Yes I've invited Mart to stay here 
What made you do that 
He's Sam's closest friend 
I don't know why it didn't occur to me days ago 
I don't like the idea at all 
Having this man in the house with you 
But Fred Grace is here 
That's not the point Oh don't be stuffy 
But how can I do that now 
Invent some excuse It's not difficult 
You mean you won't 
Oh Fred really I don't see why you should 
Will you stop 
I'm sick of hearing how stupid I am 
That sounds like Georgia and Sam So soon 
But they weren't coming back for another week 
Work is fine but what you want 
All right skip it 
Sam it's such a silly 
I said skip it and I meant skip it 
Hello Sam 
Hello darling 
Have a good trip 
Yes wonderful 
Yes until I spoiled it with my crazy notion 
Sam wants to run the paper 
Look Sam you wouldn't suddenly 
Sam Fred's part of the family 
No it doesn't 
I'm sorry I made a scene Oh now 
It's just that I 
I don't know

Good night 
Night 
Night 
Well I'll call you tomorrow Fred 
You're angry with me No 
Sure not Yes 
Yes 
Well aren't you gonna kiss me good night 
Good night Helen 
Helen 
Helen 
Why were you against me tonight 
Because Fred was 
And you love Fred desperately 
I love Fred 
You love Fred 
Why this sudden passion to run the paper 
I'd be on top 
I could make people or break them 
I could do that Do you understand 
Yes I think I do 
Sure you do 
Because your roots are down where mine are 
I knew that the first time I saw you 
Soul mates huh 
Stop laughing 
What's wrong with you 
You know how I feel about Georgia 
Do I 
Unless you're a fool 
She means no more to me than Fred to you 
Very interesting 
He does though What 
What Helen 
Fred is peace and security 
It's his money then Yes partly 
Without him I'm afraid of the things I'll do 
Afraid of what I might become 
Fred is goodness and safety 
And what am I 
You 
You're strength excitement and depravity 
There's a kind of corruptness inside of you 
That would drive most women off 
Yes But not you 
You have guts 
Georgia told me how you found those two in Reno 
You had guts then 
You didn't yell or faint No 
No I didn't 
Helen 
Oh there you are 
What are you doing here 
I'm moving in 
Whose idea was that 
Helen suggested it 
Good night 
You sure picked a fine time to bust in 
I need a drink 
Do you know the number 
Yes 
What is the number please 
22 766 
Who's calling please 
I'm Mrs Brent 
Thank you I'll call it Thank you 
Play it close to your vest Meaning what 
Leave Helen alone 
Why 
I just told you 
Not that I blame you of course 
Helen's a creamy dish but she's 
Oh Sam Never mind the Oh Sam 
Just remember what I told you 
No I don't want to talk to anyone else in Reno 
What's wrong 
Helen 
She just phoned a guy in Reno 
Reno 
I don't get her 
I don't get her at all 
Maybe I was a fool 
I would have sworn 
What 
Maybe not 
Maybe she is against me 
I don't know 
She feels and digs and looks inside of me 
Sam Sam take it easy 
We'll work it out somehow Just take it easy 
I've done rather well 
How well 
And when you fill in what's missing 
Naturally I'm deeply interested 
Like murder 
I presume that so far your client knows nothing 
Your presumption is correct 
Mr Arnett I 
It's quite all right Mrs Brent 
Well I'm prepared to pay handsomely Good 
I am not a rich woman I know that 
But your sister is very rich 
Seven thousand 
Fifteen 
I doubt very much if I can manage to get it 
You know Mrs Brent I'm a simple man 
Good night 
Good night 
Has it occurred to you 
Neither of us looks like a scoundrel do we 
Where have you been 
That's my affair 
Where have you been 
Seeing him about what 
I knew you hadn't committed any murder 
How'd you find out about him 
He was at your wedding 
That isn't why you went It is 
You're lying Take it easy Sam 
I don't think she is 
Whose side are you on anyway 
Oh Sam 
What did she say that detective's name was 
Arnett 
Mrs Kraft please 
618 Thank you 
Deal Gotta add up 
Why 
Find out who won 
I won Who says

How's the search coming along 
That's what I'm gonna find out 
Shut that will you 
Cold's eating into me Pleasure pleasure 
Virginia

You're a poor substitute for Laury 
Are you calling me a liar Yes

Can I help you 
Yes 
Well the 10 of diamonds we were looking for 
Why sure enough 
Yes 
See who it is 
Yeah 
Oh it's you That's all 
Take you on tomorrow and I'll beat you again 
Yeah in a pig's eye 
I've got nothing to keep me in Reno 
Now Mrs Kraft I didn't say he was here 
What made you come here then 
Look a certain young man came here 
Poor Laury I hope she's in heaven now 
No 
But he gave me a lead 
What good's a lead 
It's high time you found out something 
All right Mrs Kraft 
Thank you 
Yes 
How do you do Mrs Kraft 
Who are you 
Take your foot out of my door 
Thank you

How much is it gonna cost me 
No I'll prove to you I'm strictly on the level 
Fair enough 
I'm a bad boy You are huh 
I don't like it Me I love it 
I love it the best in the world 
I loved Laury too

Good morning boys Morning sir 
We appreciate your assistance of course but 
The boys and I were only trying to help 
You and your boys 
We don't like them We don't want them 
Why don't you break them up Captain 
Let me be the policeman eh 
You just serve your time 
And that way we'll both get paid off 
That's right Captain 
All of us 
Wasn't his fault 
Sorry Lister 
Ah the warden's breakfast ready and made 
With the ham and eggs and the marmalade 
Is uh Captain Munsey gonna be there 
Brandy's the very best drink in the world 
If you drink enough your toes get curled 
And maybe that's the way it should be 
You don't like this place Doc 
What for you stay here 
You haven't got much choice Calypso 
Neither have I 
Why not 
The world we live in 
Nobody wants to help Not us 
Manufacturers unions

But I'm getting tired of you in both roles 
We don't want to be bothered anymore 
Is that clear Warden 
Yes sir 
Clear to you Doctor 
Oh absolutely 
You can't be bothered 
Well that simplifies everything 
The great public and its servants 
But is it over 
You and your patent medicine remedies 
Change the warden 
New personnel Absolute discipline 
Do you know what this prison is Mr McCallum 
One big human bomb 
Warden

But Henrietta's a blonde 
She don't look nothin' like her 
She doesn't have to 
I never told you gentlemen about Flossie did I 
The dice were hot and she kept them that way 
I was heading for a fortune 
I heard the old familiar noises 
So Flossie had me slip the gun into her purse 
Obviously the girl was no tourist 
I figured myself a pretty lucky guy 
She was better than a deck with six aces 
Now I was positive 
I couldn't find the right words 
I wonder who Flossie's fleecing now 
I don't get it 
Who knows 
Just so they happened on the outside 
All right Go ahead

Please Captain let me alone 
I'm the one that decides that 
I'm the only one who can help you No one else 
Captain I'm a cheap thief 
I know I'm a failure but I'm not an informer
